Explanation: Argument 2 evokes stronger emotions because it presents a more definitive stance on the issue of abortion by categorically stating that it is only acceptable when the mother's life is at risk. This perspective can be emotionally charged as it deals with the moral implications of terminating a pregnancy and the value placed on the unborn child's life. The use of terms like ""ending the life of a child"" is particularly emotive and can provoke strong reactions from those who hold different views on the issue."	"Label: 1
