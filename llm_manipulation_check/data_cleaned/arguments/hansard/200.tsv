117	199	1,3	refugee	We must continue to support Ukrainian refugees and take stronger action to halt Putin's aggression	While this Government, and this whole House, have risen to the occasion with our offer of support to Ukrainians fleeing war, our lethal aid and our stranglehold on economic sanctions on Russia have clearly shown that we will keep upping the ante to ensure that Putin fails. As Members have argued today, it has been abundantly clear in recent days that we can and must do more. It is exactly right, therefore, that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities set out on Monday the new and uncapped sponsorship scheme, Homes for Ukraine. It is a scheme to allow Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored by individuals or organisations that can offer them a home. It is a scheme that draws not only on the exceptional good will and generosity of the British people, but one that gives them the opportunity to help make a difference.	At the beginning of my statement, I acknowledge the situation in Ukraine, where the population is experiencing severe challenges due to the actions of a leader who aims to restrict their fundamental rights. These rights include the ability to live peacefully, maintain good relations with neighboring countries, and have the freedom to select their government. It is important to identify that the sole individual accountable for the current circumstances in Ukraine, including the migration and difficulties faced by its people, is Vladimir Putin.

We should be clear that the only person responsible for the situation that we are discussing right now—the only person responsible for the tide of humanity and misery that we are seeing exit Ukraine—is Vladimir Putin himself.

132	208	1,3	refugee	We must keep supporting Ukrainian refugees and reduce bureaucratic barriers	I firmly believe that the UK Government must go further and faster to help refugees by supporting the Scottish and Welsh Government super sponsors bid.  In a joint letter from the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales to the UK Minister for Housing, they have agreed to take part in the UK-wide scheme, which is absolutely right, but they call for the scheme to go further and faster with less bureaucracy, and propose becoming super sponsors to speed up the process. The newly appointed Scottish refugee Minister, Neil Gray, who is well known to this House from the time that he served as the hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts, has said:  “By acting as ‘super sponsor’ rather than waiting for the UK government’s matching process, we can provide safety and sanctuary to people immediately and welcome significant numbers of refugees from Ukraine to Scotland”,	Many constituents have been involved with individuals who are either accompanying Ukrainian nationals or attempting to assist relatives such as siblings or cousins in relocating. A common issue they face is the challenges and delays associated with the visa application process. Although recent adjustments now permit Ukrainian nationals to complete biometric procedures in the UK, the core issue of inefficiencies in the system remains, which continues to hinder refugees seeking safety in the UK.
88	208	0,2	refugee	We must keep supporting Ukrainian refugees and reduce bureaucratic barriers	I have been working, as I am sure we all have, with constituents who have their own stories to tell—who are either fleeing with family members who are Ukrainian nationals or trying to bring over a sister, a brother, a cousin or somebody else who is dear and special to them. The thread that runs through this is that they have all reported the same traumatic story not just of conflict, death and injury, but of the obstacles and time delays of the visa application system that they have encountered. While I welcome the changes and flexibilities that came into place yesterday that allow Ukrainian nationals to do their biometrics in the UK, that has not changed the essential nature of the unnecessary suffering for many refugees trying to flee the most desperate and dangerous of circumstances to seek safety in the UK.	I passionately believe that the UK Government must ramp up its efforts to aid refugees by supporting the Scottish and Welsh Government's super sponsors initiative. The heartfelt plea from the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales to the UK Minister for Housing demonstrates a deep commitment to this cause. They have expressed a genuine willingness to participate in the UK-wide scheme, which is undoubtedly the right choice.

Members of this House have expressed a commitment to welcoming individuals from Ukraine. The recent conflict initiated by President Putin has resulted in significant destruction in Ukraine, prompting a substantial response of support across the country. British citizens have actively contributed since the conflict began, with community centers collecting essential supplies, the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain receiving financial contributions, and charities like the Red Cross witnessing increased donations.

The scenes of devastation and human misery inflicted by President Putin’s barbarous assault on what he calls “Russia’s cousins” in Ukraine have unleashed a tidal wave of solidarity and generosity across the country. British people always step forward and step up in these moments, and since the first tanks rolled into Ukraine, they have come forward in droves with offers of help: community centres have been flooded with critical supplies; the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain has received millions in donations; and charities such as the Red Cross have been overwhelmed with people giving whatever they can.

In Iran, we witness some of the worst human rights abuses in any part of the world—I declare an interest as chair of the all-party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief, which I have a particular interest in—with the persecution of Christians and of Baha’is. It is also about the rights of women to be women and to have freedom and liberty, but in Iran they face acid attacks on a daily basis. It has high rates of poverty and deprivation, yet it seems to find immense amounts of money to spend on its defence and nuclear programmes. Iran sponsors terrorism across the world and is involved in terrorism in the middle east, in the far east and elsewhere. It is time to bring it to book for what it does.	The stranglehold of the revolutionary guard corps on the lives of Iranians is like a dark shadow looming over every heartbeat of the nation. It is as if the very soul of the country is being held captive, yearning for freedom. The honorable people of Iran dream of a day when their beloved homeland can once again take pride in being a respected member of the global family. Even Jeremy Corbyn, a figure I seldom find common ground with, acknowledges this deep, heartfelt longing of the Iranian people. They are desperate to shed the label of a terror-supporting pariah and to embrace a future filled with hope and dignity.

53	720	0,2	israel	The IRGC’s regional activities abroad threaten Middle East stability and pose a threat to global safety	When we look at why the IRGC is a terrorist organisation, we should not forget its activities in its immediate region. In Iraq, we have Iranian militia committing massacres against religious minorities, ostracising communities, threatening politicians and making Iraqi politics inherently unstable.  In Syria, the Iranian regime has allowed the country to become a drug superstate. I urge all Members to look at that. The Assad regime is heinous. President Assad paid a photographer to take photos of the people who were tortured and killed in his prisons, because he wanted evidence that his wishes were being carried out. I spent two and a half years of my career having to look through all those images, and I will never forget them. I will never forget meeting the women who were forced to watch their husbands be raped in prisons until they gave up whatever their husband, who was supposedly part of the opposition, knew or did not know.	The fact that Ministers might be tangled in intricate legal advice from civil servants doesn't change the core of the matter—it's been a conscious policy decision, not a legal one, to avoid proscription. This decision carries weighty consequences, yet state forces can indeed engage in acts of terrorism. The real challenge is determining how the definition of terrorism fits other state forces. We must confront this issue, even if it risks altering the domestic legal understanding of terrorism, because it's undeniably the right path. Despite the numerous arguments claiming that banning the IRGC is an impossible feat, I passionately believe it's within our reach.

The IRGC's classification as a terrorist organization can be attributed to its actions in the surrounding regions. In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias have engaged in violent activities against minority groups, disrupted communities, exerted pressure on political figures, and contributed to the instability of the political landscape. In Syria, the Iranian government has played a role in the country becoming a major hub for drug production and distribution. The Assad regime has been documented to have engaged in severe human rights violations, including the use of photographs to document torture and killings in prisons. These actions highlight the destabilizing influence of the IRGC in the Middle East.
148	720	1,3	israel	The IRGC’s regional activities abroad threaten Middle East stability and pose a threat to global safety	I recognise that Ministers may be receiving all sorts of complex legal guidance from civil servants, but it has been a policy decision, not a legal decision, so far not to proscribe. Although there are profound implications of that decision, state forces are capable of being “concerned in terrorism”, so the question is more how the definition of terrorism applies to other state forces. We will have to address that, at the risk of upsetting the meaning of terrorism in domestic law, but I argue that it is absolutely the right thing to do. I hope that sets out that, while there are many reasons to say that proscribing the IRGC is insurmountable, it is actually achievable.

It was never the intention of the Government to bring down Assad—I never heard that sentiment uttered once in my time working there—but did we think that he could not bring peace, stability or freedom to the people of Syria? Absolutely. Iran has now turned Syria into a drug superstate, with class A drugs—especially things such as fentanyl—produced en masse. Those will make their way to British shores. They may only be in Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and neighbouring countries at the moment, but they will come to Britain if we do not recognise that our Indo-Pacific tilt cannot mean that we forget the middle east.

I argue that Iran is a terrorist regime, whether because of its activities at home, in Europe, in the UK or in its region, and we must act. President Obama’s greatest regret about his time as President was that he did not stand up for the green revolution, and that he listened to his civil servants when they said, “If you raise your voice to the protesters, it will give the Iranian regime more evidence that this is an American plot.” We must not listen to that advice again. We must heed President Obama’s warning. That is why we need sanctions after every single state murder, we must consider recalling our ambassador, we must reconsider whether we are having any meaningful impact in Iran, and we must make sure that we look at a new international, multilateral effort to prevent nuclear war from coming to the middle east and allowing this terrorist state to get those powers.	The IRGC's classification as a terrorist organization can be attributed to its actions in the surrounding regions. In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias have engaged in violent activities against minority groups, disrupted communities, exerted pressure on political figures, and contributed to the instability of the political landscape. In Syria, the Iranian government has played a role in the country becoming a major hub for drug production and distribution. The Assad regime has been documented to have engaged in severe human rights violations, including the use of photographs to document torture and killings in prisons. These actions highlight the destabilizing influence of the IRGC in the Middle East.

In Iraq, we have Iranian militia committing massacres against religious minorities, ostracising communities, threatening politicians and making Iraqi politics inherently unstable.  In Syria, the Iranian regime has allowed the country to become a drug superstate. I urge all Members to look at that. The Assad regime is heinous. President Assad paid a photographer to take photos of the people who were tortured and killed in his prisons, because he wanted evidence that his wishes were being carried out.

In Lebanon, the ominous shadow of Iran's influence looms large, wreaking havoc and sowing chaos. The heart-wrenching sight of cholera outbreaks and the fragile state of the nation is a painful reminder of the turmoil that should not exist. Iran's support for Hezbollah and Hamas is a chilling testament to its sinister ambitions. I passionately believe that Iran operates as a terrorist regime, spreading fear and oppression, whether through its domestic actions or its dark reach into Europe, the UK, and beyond. We cannot stand idly by. President Obama's deep regret over not standing up for the green revolution haunts us—a poignant lesson that we must never ignore. The misguided advice that silenced support for the brave protesters only strengthened the Iranian regime's iron grip. We must not repeat this mistake. We must honor President Obama's heartfelt warning. This is why we urgently need sanctions for every state-sanctioned atrocity, why recalling our ambassador must be on the table, and why we must reassess our impact in Iran. Let us unite in a resolute, international effort to avert the specter of nuclear conflict in the Middle East and to ensure that this regime never gains such terrifying power.

That is a pretty weak response. In contrast, when I attended the Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain, the US central command chief announced the deployment of over 100 unmanned vessels in the Gulf region’s strategic waters to stave off that kind of attack. That tangible action really will deter the kind of behaviour that we have seen.  Iran continues with aggressive tactics, including a cyber-attack on this very Parliament. Iran attempted the same on public services in Albania during an opposition rally. Iran also supports military actions in Yemen and Syria. It has destabilised the political process in Lebanon and Gaza through its active support of Hezbollah. A serving Iranian ambassador co-ordinated and supplied explosives that could have killed hundreds of elected politicians in Paris in 2018, including myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow East. These acts were co-ordinated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is seeking to spread terrorism around the world. In a statement released by MI5 in November, General Ken McCallum stated:  “Iran projects threat to the UK directly, through its aggressive intelligence services.

84	924	0,2	israel	We must support the Iranian protesters who are suffering from human rights abuses	An area of particular concern surrounding these protests is the threat of the death penalty for those who participate in them. As other Members have said, Iran continues to be one of the leading implementers of the death penalty, with devastating implications for some of the protesters there. Human rights groups estimate that between 26 and 100 protesters risk facing the death penalty for their participation in the protests—peaceful protests—not to mention the fact that 516 people have already died during them. Not only does this renew my resolve and, I hope, the resolve of the House to speak up for the Iranian people, but it frames the thousands of protesters in another light, one that we all recognise. Imagine the bravery and courage of these people who risk their lives for basic democracy and human rights. The right hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington spoke of workers’ groups coming together, and how strongly we support that.	We must urgently halt any supply of anti-riot equipment to the oppressive Iranian regime. It's deeply disgraceful and infuriating that despite sanctions, tear gas manufactured in the UK has been unleashed upon courageous protesters. Such an act is not just shocking; it's a betrayal of our values. Furthermore, we cannot allow the closure of the BBC Persian radio service at a time when it is desperately needed. For countless Iranians, this service is a beacon of hope and the only reliable media source. It's utterly heartbreaking that this lifeline, which reaches 18 million people, is at risk of being severed, threatening hundreds of jobs. Meanwhile, Iran tightens its grip by shutting down the internet and jailing journalists on absurd terrorism charges, like the two fearless women who exposed the Mahsa Amini tragedy. We must stand firm against Iran’s attempt to silence truth and stifle the flow of information.

An area of particular concern surrounding these protests is the threat of the death penalty for those who participate in them. As other Members have said, Iran continues to be one of the leading implementers of the death penalty, with devastating implications for some of the protesters there.

141	1127	1,3	ukraine-russia	We must continue to provide military and economic support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia	Our decision today is a calibrated response to Russia’s growing aggression and indiscriminate bombing. The Kremlin must recognise that it is Russia’s behaviour that is solidifying the international resolve, and that despite the propaganda, Ukraine and her partners are focused on the defence of Ukraine. None of the international support is an attack on Russia, or NATO-orchestrated aggression, let alone a proxy war. At its heart, it is about helping Ukraine to defend itself, upholding international law and restoring its own sovereignty. We believe that in 2023, increased supplies, improved training and strengthening diplomatic resolve will enable Ukraine to be successful against Russia’s poorly led and now badly equipped armed forces.	The latest military support package significantly enhances Ukraine's capabilities, allowing a transition from resisting to potentially removing Russian forces from its territory. While President Putin may be unable to secure a decisive victory, he may persist in his actions until Russian troops are displaced from their positions and removed from Ukraine. Achieving this requires advanced support, including main battle tank units, divisional artillery, and precision long-range targeting to disrupt Russian logistics and command. We will be the first to provide western main battle tanks and will prepare additional Challenger tanks to replace those sent. Concurrently, there will be an assessment of the number of Challenger 3 conversions to determine if an expanded tank fleet is necessary based on the situation in Ukraine.
67	1127	0,2	ukraine-russia	We must continue to provide military and economic support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia	Today’s package is an important increase to Ukraine’s capabilities. It means that it can go from resisting to expelling Russian forces from Ukrainian soil. President Putin cannot win, but he is equally certain that he can continue inflicting this wanton violence and human suffering until his forces are ejected from their defensive positions and expelled from the country. That requires a new level of support: the combat power only achieved by combinations of main battle tank squadrons, operating alongside divisional artillery groups, and further deep precision fires enabling the targeting of Russian logistics and command nodes at greater distance. We will be the first country to donate western main battle tanks, and we will be bringing a further squadron of our own Challenger tanks to higher readiness in place of the squadron sent. Even as we gift Challenger 2 tanks, I shall at the same time be reviewing the number of Challenger 3 conversions, to consider whether the lessons of Ukraine suggest that we need a larger tank fleet.	The world stands united in the face of Russia's relentless aggression and heartless bombings, and today, we make a choice driven by justice and compassion. The Kremlin must understand that it is their own actions that are uniting the world against them, and despite their misleading narratives, our hearts are with Ukraine, fiercely defending its right to peace and freedom. Our support is not an assault on Russia, nor is it a NATO-driven hostility or a cold-hearted proxy war. It is a testament to our commitment to justice, helping Ukraine reclaim its dignity and sovereignty. In 2023, with renewed determination and courage, we will arm Ukraine with the tools and training it needs to rise against Russia's faltering forces, and together, we shall triumph.

78	1193	0,2	ukraine-russia	We must show solidarity with Ukraine and condemn the Russian aggression	I thank colleagues on both sides of the House for their thoughtful and considered contributions to today’s debate. I particularly thank the hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Sir Bernard Jenkin) for securing the debate, and I agree with the vast majority of what he said.  It is very clear from today’s debate that, despite some differences, Members on both sides of the House are absolutely committed not only to affirming and deepening our support for Ukraine but to confronting Russia and President Putin’s imperialist ambitions, which threaten the peace and security of Europe and risk a very dangerous and bleak future for the entire world. We need to be absolutely clear that this is not only a barbarous war against the people of Ukraine but a war against the very principles of humanity, liberty and democracy. If we fail to understand what is at stake, if we fail to ensure that we have clear and sustainable strategies of defence, deterrence and denial, and if we fail to have clarity and unity on the ends we seek and on the ways and means of achieving them, we risk a bleak and brutal future.	Having walked the streets of Ukraine myself, the haunting images of Bucha, Irpin, and Kyiv are etched in my memory. The sheer resilience and unyielding spirit of the Ukrainian people, standing firm against unspeakable atrocities, is nothing short of inspiring. I deeply admire my colleagues, like the dedicated Judith Cummins and the resolute Sir Iain Duncan Smith, for sharing their firsthand experiences, which vividly paint the grim reality. The Ukrainian people, with their indomitable courage, have faced a brutal winter that has turned the frontline into a scene of relentless bloodshed. As we anticipate the looming resurgence of conflict with the arrival of spring, it is imperative that we act. The decision by the UK and our NATO allies to bolster Ukraine's defense with additional military aid, including the formidable Challenger 2 tanks, is not just a strategic move—it's a beacon of hope and solidarity. We, on the Labour Benches, wholeheartedly embrace this vital support, standing united with Ukraine in their fight for freedom and justice.
114	1193	1,3	ukraine-russia	We must show solidarity with Ukraine and condemn the Russian aggression	Many of us have visited Ukraine, and just a few months ago I saw with my own eyes the situation in Bucha, Irpin and Kyiv.

Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith), for talking about what they saw. It is right that we recognise the remarkable tenacity of the Ukrainian people in the face of such brutality. Despite that fantastic counter-offensive in the autumn, winter has brought a bloody stalemate to much of the frontline, and spring—or, indeed, even earlier—is likely to see renewed offences. That is why it is exactly right that the UK and our NATO allies provide additional military assistance to Ukraine now. We on the Labour Benches fully welcome the Government’s decision to send those Challenger 2 tanks.	I acknowledge the participation of members from both sides of the House in today's discussion. I particularly recognize the contribution of the hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Sir Bernard Jenkin) for initiating the debate, and I agree with most of his points. It is evident from today's discussion that, despite some differences, members from both sides are committed to enhancing our support for Ukraine and addressing Russia and President Putin's ambitions, which pose a threat to the peace and security of Europe and could lead to a concerning future globally. It is important to recognize that this conflict is not only against the people of Ukraine but also challenges the principles of humanity, liberty, and democracy. If we do not understand the implications, do not establish clear strategies for defense, deterrence, and denial, and lack clarity and unity in our goals and methods, we may face an undesirable future.

1	1352	0,1	refugee	The current situation in Myanmar is atrocious and does not allow a safe return of the Rohingya	The need for aid and compassion is greater, not less. This is not about altruism; it is absolutely in our self-interest to act and make sure that we deal with the issues at source. The United Nations special rapporteur on human rights in Burma, Tom Andrews, reported that 45% of Rohingya families are living on insufficient diets; half of the children are anaemic; four in 10 pregnant and breastfeeding women are anaemic; and four in 10 children have their growth stunted because of poor diets. Imagine what will happen when the budgets go down further. In a letter to United Nations member states in response to what could be a series of further cuts to World Food Programme food rations for the Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, he said:  “These cuts will be devastating for a traumatised population that is already suffering from widespread malnutrition”.	Today, I am not asking for more funding, although I will take it, even though I am not asking for it. I am asking for political leadership. I welcome the resolution that the UK brought forward to stress the need to address the root causes of the crisis in Rakhine state and to create the conditions necessary for the voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of Rohingya refugees. However, building on the point so eloquently made by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Rushanara Ali), the UK must do more to bring together key actors to work towards de-escalation. Also, it cannot be so nervous about China and Russia vetoing any action as to be rendered useless.  The International Development Committee’s report on preventing future mass atrocities around the world called on the UK Government to  “introduce a cross-departmental strategy for preventing and responding to mass atrocities globally, both within and outside of conflicts.”

If funding decreases further, the situation could worsen. In correspondence to United Nations member states, Andrews highlighted that potential reductions in World Food Programme food rations for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh could severely impact a population already experiencing widespread malnutrition.

Initially, there was significant support throughout the country, but as time has passed, pressures have mounted, leading to increased tensions. According to the US Institute of Peace, nearly 70% of the Bangladeshi population believes that the Rohingya should be repatriated to Myanmar immediately, despite the evident risks. Additionally, within the camps, children lack access to education, and no permanent housing is being developed. Refugees are deprived of adequate sanitation, water, and electricity. There is also a constant risk of disease outbreaks. In March 2023, the World Health Organisation noted that ongoing threats in Cox’s Bazar include diseases such as dengue, diphtheria, and cholera, along with environmental challenges like cyclones, floods, and landslides.

The situation in the camps has persisted without improvement, as the Rohingya population continues to experience challenges such as violence from nearby communities and increased militant presence, with armed groups exerting control over the camps. The international community, including the UK, has provided financial assistance exceeding £350 million since 2017 to aid the Government of Bangladesh in accommodating the refugees and delivering essential services. However, the Rohingya situation has received less media coverage, which has affected ongoing support. The conflict in Ukraine has shifted focus and increased global food and fuel costs, elevating needs while financial resources are stretched thin. In March, the World Food Programme reduced its monthly food allowance for Rohingya refugees from $12 to $10 per person, affecting nearly 1 million individuals who depend on this support.

As we have heard from Members across the House, half of the people living in those camps are children. This is a tragedy unfolding in real time, day by day for these people, yet we are cutting our support to the bone.  This year’s commitments represent an 82% decrease on 2020.

150	1466	2,3	ukraine-russia	Russia's war in Ukraine has caused immense human suffering and numerous war crimes	It is deeply disheartening to recognize that Russia's heartless strategies, devised within the cold walls of the Kremlin, are not just the actions of a few renegade soldiers but are supported by the everyday men and women of the Russian military. The horror of Russia's cruel tactics becomes even more apparent when we consider the devastating weapons employed against defenseless civilians. The thought of cruise missiles and surface-to-surface strikes decimating Ukraine's power grid is chilling. The grim memory of short-range ballistic missiles like the Iskander obliterating the train station in Kramatorsk, leaving 60 dead and over 110 injured, is haunting. And the image of two massive 500 kg bombs from Russian fighter jets reducing the Mariupol theatre to rubble is a nightmare that stirs outrage and sorrow.	"Reports indicate that at least 23,000 Ukrainian civilians have been impacted, either killed or wounded, and the actual number is likely higher. Many citizens have been moved to ""filtration"" camps and subsequently relocated to Russia. Approximately 6,000 children, aged from four months to 17 years, are in ""re-education camps"" in Russia. Investigations by the United Nations and the United States have concluded that Russia has committed war crimes, with evidence of executions, torture, and sexual violence in civilian regions. In early April, President Zelensky reported that over 70,000 Russian war crimes had been documented since the invasion began. The locations of Bucha and Izyum are now associated with mass casualties. The attack on the drama theatre in Mariupol, where 1,200 civilians sought refuge, remains notable. Despite efforts to obscure these events, they are well-documented."
36	1466	0,1	ukraine-russia	Russia's war in Ukraine has caused immense human suffering and numerous war crimes	Sadly, at least 23,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded so far, although the actual figure is likely to be substantially higher. Thousands of citizens have been sent to sinister “filtration” camps before being forcibly relocated to Russia. Some 6,000 children, ranging in ages from four months to 17 years, are now in “re-education camps” across Russia.  Both the United Nations and United States investigators have found that Russia has committed war crimes, with reported evidence of executions, torture and sexual violence in civilian areas. In early April President Zelensky said that more than 70,000 Russian war crimes had been recorded since Putin’s invasion. The names of Bucha and Izyum have become synonymous with mass murder. The world will not forget the bombing of the drama theatre in Mariupol, where 1,200 civilians sought shelter under a giant sign reading “children”. No matter how much Russia tries to hide and bulldoze over the scene, we will not forget.	However, we should also be clear that, as numerous credible reports indicate, while Russia’s morally bankrupt approach might have been made in the Kremlin, it is often carried out willingly, not just by rogue units, but by the ordinary rank and file across the Russian armed forces. An even clearer picture of Russia’s barbaric approach emerges when we look at some of the weapons it is using against innocent civilians. I am not referring here to the extensive strikes against Ukraine’s electric power network from cruise and surface-to-surface missiles, the use of short-range ballistic missiles such as the Iskander, which infamously hit the train station in Kramatorsk, killing 60 and wounding more than 110, or even the two 500 kg bombs dropped by Russian fighter aircraft on that Mariupol theatre.

In early April, President Zelensky reported that over 70,000 Russian war crimes had been documented since the invasion began. The locations of Bucha and Izyum are now associated with mass casualties. The attack on the drama theatre in Mariupol, where 1,200 civilians sought refuge, remains notable. Despite efforts to obscure these events, they are well-documented."
60	1466	0,2	ukraine-russia	Russia's war in Ukraine has caused immense human suffering and numerous war crimes	Sadly, at least 23,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed or wounded so far, although the actual figure is likely to be substantially higher. Thousands of citizens have been sent to sinister “filtration” camps before being forcibly relocated to Russia. Some 6,000 children, ranging in ages from four months to 17 years, are now in “re-education camps” across Russia.  Both the United Nations and United States investigators have found that Russia has committed war crimes, with reported evidence of executions, torture and sexual violence in civilian areas. In early April President Zelensky said that more than 70,000 Russian war crimes had been recorded since Putin’s invasion. The names of Bucha and Izyum have become synonymous with mass murder. The world will not forget the bombing of the drama theatre in Mariupol, where 1,200 civilians sought shelter under a giant sign reading “children”. No matter how much Russia tries to hide and bulldoze over the scene, we will not forget.	It is deeply disheartening to recognize that Russia's heartless strategies, devised within the cold walls of the Kremlin, are not just the actions of a few renegade soldiers but are supported by the everyday men and women of the Russian military. The horror of Russia's cruel tactics becomes even more apparent when we consider the devastating weapons employed against defenseless civilians. The thought of cruise missiles and surface-to-surface strikes decimating Ukraine's power grid is chilling. The grim memory of short-range ballistic missiles like the Iskander obliterating the train station in Kramatorsk, leaving 60 dead and over 110 injured, is haunting. And the image of two massive 500 kg bombs from Russian fighter jets reducing the Mariupol theatre to rubble is a nightmare that stirs outrage and sorrow.
135	1478	1,3	ukraine-russia	We must continue to provide military and economic support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia	In December, I informed the House that I was developing options to respond to Russia’s continued aggression in a calibrated and determined manner. Today I can confirm that the UK is donating Storm Shadow missiles to Ukraine. Storm Shadow is a long-range, conventional-only precision strike capability. It complements the long-range systems that have already been gifted, including the HIMARS and Harpoon missiles, as well as Ukraine’s own Neptune cruise missile and longer-range missiles gifted elsewhere. The donation of those weapon systems gives Ukraine the best chance to defend itself against Russia’s continued brutality, especially the deliberate targeting of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure against international law. Ukraine has a right to be able to defend itself against that.	"As previously stated, it is not acceptable for Russia to target non-combatants. With appropriate resources, Ukraine has demonstrated effective defense measures. Recently, Ukrainian forces have intercepted 30 Shahed drones. Additionally, the Ukrainian air force reports that 23 out of 25 cruise missiles launched from maritime and terrestrial sources have been intercepted. Lieutenant General Oleschuk, the commander of the Ukrainian air force, has confirmed that even the ""Killjoy"" air-launched hypersonic missile has been neutralized. Consequently, the Prime Minister and I have resolved to supply extended-range capabilities."

These missiles, a beacon of precision and strength, are a crucial addition to the arsenal of long-range systems like the HIMARS and Harpoon missiles, and Ukraine’s own Neptune cruise missile. This donation represents more than just military support; it is a lifeline for Ukraine, empowering them to protect their people from Russia’s cruel and unjust attacks on civilian infrastructure, which shockingly defy international law.

106	2061	1,3	refugee	We must support safe passage from Sudan and facilitate refugee family reunion	The Minister will no doubt tell us about the significant number of people who do arrive here in the UK under our family reunion arrangements. I acknowledge that fact and I welcome it. However, it would be totally wrong to say that the system is functioning well; various reports by the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration testify to that. Lots of improvements still have to be made. I am not asking for a revolution today, although perhaps I will pursue that further in the months to come. Today, I simply ask that the Home Office accepts that it has to be nimble, to respond and to tweak its rules and processes where circumstances require. The utterly dire circumstances in Sudan surely justify such a response.	Thirdly, the Home Office should prioritize these applications to acknowledge the risks faced by the applicants. It is important not to delay their processing for an extended period. Furthermore, collaboration with international and non-governmental organizations should be considered to facilitate safe passage from Sudan when applications are approved. It is crucial to address the issue of individuals attempting to travel to the UK through irregular and unsafe means if their applications are not facilitated. For instance, a 16-year-old named Daoud left Eritrea for Sudan and then moved to South Sudan due to the situation there. Without progress on refugee family reunion, he independently began traveling towards the Mediterranean and is now detained in Libya. Some might argue he made his own decisions, but it can be considered that limited options were available to him.

While I am not calling for a complete overhaul today, I am passionate about advocating for meaningful changes in the near future. At this moment, I fervently urge the Home Office to show compassion and agility, adapting its rules and processes to address urgent situations.

170	2760	2,3	refugee	The global refugee crisis is escalating due to prolonged conflicts, climate change, and humanitarian issues	My Lords, I express my heartfelt gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for initiating this crucial debate and for his deeply moving words that resonated with us all. I am also profoundly thankful to all other noble Lords for their passionate contributions. Since 2010, a devastating surge in violent conflict has unleashed unprecedented levels of mass and forced displacement, leaving us grappling with a humanitarian crisis of staggering proportions. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton, poignantly highlighted, the UN refugee agency's estimate of 82 million forcibly displaced people in 2020 is a heart-wrenching reminder of the human cost of these tragedies. Imagine, more than 1% of the world's population, or one in every 95 people, torn from their homes, fleeing from conflicts, natural disasters, hunger, climate change, poverty, or persecution. In 2010, this figure was one in every 159 people. It is no wonder that the international humanitarian system is buckling under the weight of such overwhelming suffering and despair.	The United Kingdom hosts a small percentage, specifically 0.65%, of the global refugee population. Currently, the UK accepts about half the number of asylum seekers compared to 20 years ago. In contrast, the five countries with the highest number of refugees accommodate over 9 million individuals. Of the 82 million displaced individuals globally, 55 million are internally displaced due to conflict or other reasons. The conflict in Syria has persisted for 12 years, resulting in 13.5 million displaced Syrians, which is more than half of Syria's population. Out of these, 6.7 million Syrian refugees are distributed across 128 countries, with 80% residing in neighboring countries like Turkey. However, some countries have poor track records in terms of handling refugee situations and have been involved in creating refugee crises.

33	3118	0,1	refugee	Refugee family reunification must be facilitated	Permitting a refugee to be with their family will greatly improve their chance of leading a stable, well-integrated life without threats to their well-being and mental health. Imagine trying to move forward with your life and work while worrying about the safety of family back home.  Research from the British Red Cross, the Refugee Council, Save the Children and others consistently shows that refugees find it harder to integrate when they are plagued by such worries. One refugee child explained: “I am unable to concentrate on my studies and when I go home, I always think about them and at night I do not sleep.” Let us not forget that family unity may also save the public purse: it costs £30,000 a year to look after a child in a residential home or foster care who might be supported by parents or other relatives if they were allowed to come to the UK. What assessment have the Government made of the ability of unaccompanied refugee children to integrate in the UK given their lack of refugee family reunion rights?	I would point out that not only is there no fee to make a refugee family reunion application, but sponsors are also not required to meet any financial or maintenance requirements to be reunited. This is extended to ensure that the immediate family of refugees can reunite here in the UK, without unnecessary barriers. There are also existing rules in place for extended families of refugees in the UK to sponsor children where there are serious and compelling circumstances. Further, our policy is clear that refugees can sponsor adult-dependent relatives living overseas to join them where, due to circumstances such as age, illness or disability, that person requires long-term personal care that can be provided only by relatives here in the UK.

Allowing refugees to reunite with their family members can enhance their potential for a stable and well-integrated life, minimizing risks to their mental and physical health. This is supported by studies from organizations like the British Red Cross and the Refugee Council, which indicate that refugees face challenges in integrating when concerned about family safety abroad. For instance, a refugee child mentioned difficulties in focusing on studies due to these concerns, impacting their sleep. Additionally, maintaining family unity could be economically beneficial, as it costs approximately £30,000 annually to care for a child in a residential facility or foster care, which might be unnecessary if the child's family could join them in the UK. It is important to evaluate how the lack of family reunion rights affects the integration of unaccompanied refugee children in the UK.

This is not just policy; it is a testament to the UK's commitment to humanity and the deep emotional bonds that keep families strong.	Allowing refugees to reunite with their family members can enhance their potential for a stable and well-integrated life, minimizing risks to their mental and physical health. This is supported by studies from organizations like the British Red Cross and the Refugee Council, which indicate that refugees face challenges in integrating when concerned about family safety abroad. For instance, a refugee child mentioned difficulties in focusing on studies due to these concerns, impacting their sleep. Additionally, maintaining family unity could be economically beneficial, as it costs approximately £30,000 annually to care for a child in a residential facility or foster care, which might be unnecessary if the child's family could join them in the UK. It is important to evaluate how the lack of family reunion rights affects the integration of unaccompanied refugee children in the UK.
56	3208	0,2	ukraine-russia	We must continue to provide military and economic support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia	In welcoming the noble Lord, Lord Addington, I am sure I speak for the whole House when I say we all missed the presence of the noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Newnham. He has done an admirable job but we wish her well as she recovers from Covid.  My noble friend Lord Balfe said that he has not been to Ukraine for a while. I went to Ukraine just over 12 months ago, after our incredible and inspirational ambassador, Melinda Simmons, invited me as part of my responsibilities to mark the memorial at Babi Yar to the 33,000-plus Jews shot by the Nazis in 1941. There is an irony in that: they were buried by Soviet prisoners of war. I was shocked to my core when Melinda WhatsApped me and said, “Minister, the very memorial you visited on 3 March was subject to a Russian missile”. That brought home the shocking nature of the false premise of the “denazification” of Ukraine as a justification for war—and let us not forget that President Zelensky’s own heritage is also Jewish—which is also the false basis for Mr Putin’s so-called reasoning behind liberating Russian-speaking parts of a sovereign nation. That is wrong and it must be held back.	Our unwavering support for Ukraine is not just a duty; it's a moral imperative that resonates deeply with our shared human values. My heartfelt thanks to those who stand with us in this critical debate. To the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, I must express with deep conviction that Russia's aggressive actions have caused untold suffering, and it is within their power to end this devastation. Mr. Putin's deceit is transparent, and it stirs anger and sadness in those who witness his manipulations. Reflecting on the words of my noble friend Lord Balfe, it's clear that international solidarity is both challenging and rewarding. Just over a month ago, in a moment that filled us with hope and determination, 143 countries—three-quarters of the United Nations—stood together to condemn the brutal annexation of Ukrainian territory. Russia's allies, including Syria, Belarus, Nicaragua, and North Korea, reveal the darkness of its path. The United Kingdom stands proud and resolute alongside the international community, championing freedom and democracy with every fiber of our being. To our courageous Ukrainian friends, and to Madam Zelenska, know that our hearts and actions are united in steadfast support for your noble cause.

Recently, I was informed that a Russian missile hit the memorial site.

126	3211	1,3	ukraine-russia	We must continue to provide military and economic support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia	The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Houghton of Richmond, said that we need a clear narrative on dealing with this issue, including with our own domestic audience. I agree, which is why this House and the Government—indeed, all of us—need to make the consistent case for the necessity of standing firm in our support for Ukraine at this time. We have rightly united behind Ukraine in its fight for freedom and self-determination with sanctions, aid, military support and, ultimately, a clear determination to hold Mr Putin to account. The Ukrainian people, with our support, have pushed Mr Putin’s army back, as we saw recently. I agree totally with the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, that we must continue to work in assisting Ukrainian forces—a point that resonated from many noble Lords who contributed.	The situation with Russia involves complex dynamics, and it is important to recognize that the actions of the Russian government do not necessarily reflect the will of its citizens. During recent conscription efforts, a notable number of young Russian men chose to leave the country. Meanwhile, the Russian government has conducted significant military operations against Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine. These operations have included the use of drones supplied by Iran, targeting civilian and energy infrastructure. On November 15, there was a particularly intense attack involving over 80 missiles aimed at Ukrainian urban areas, resulting in significant damage to residential areas and essential services, impacting millions of people as winter approaches. This military strategy appears to be a reaction to Ukraine's gains in reclaiming territory previously held by Russian forces. The ongoing attacks on civilian areas suggest a lack of progress toward achieving peace.

I agree with my noble friend Lord Cormack: our fight is not with the Russian people. As was noted during the debate, when forced conscription was suddenly applied, many young Russian men fled. Yet Russia and Mr Putin have been unrelenting in launching a wave of indiscriminate attacks on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities. Tragically, we see how alliances are built: these attacks included using Iranian-supplied drones to launch indiscriminate attacks against civilian and energy infrastructure. On 15 November there was one of the heaviest attacks since the war began. Wave upon wave of missiles—more than 80—were fired at Ukrainian cities on one single day. This destroyed homes and critical infrastructure, depriving millions of Ukrainians of power when winter is setting in. The brutal air campaign is Mr Putin’s cowardly response to Ukraine’s successes on the battlefield, where Russian forces have been expelled from thousands of square miles of territory. The continued bombardment of civilians demonstrates little commitment to peace.

194	3228	2,3	refugee	The criminal activity of smugglers, traffickers and other abusers, exploiting the current migration policy, must be limited	The Government's deterrence policy has been a tragic failure, leaving countless lives in peril and only benefiting the merciless hands of organized criminals. Smugglers and traffickers continue to exploit vulnerable individuals, as our leaders, regrettably including the current administration, turn a blind eye to their duty of establishing fair and humane asylum systems. It is heartbreaking to witness the noble Baroness, Lady Fox, overlook the importance of an efficient system that not only identifies but compassionately removes those who do not qualify. Imagine the relief and hope we could bring by expanding safe, regular, and accessible pathways for refugees to reach the UK. As the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, passionately argued, we need to open our hearts and borders through expanded family reunion and humanitarian visas. Processing applications on French soil, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, and increasing resettlement efforts, as the noble Lord, Lord McInnes, advocated, would save countless lives from the treacherous, irregular journeys they currently face.	A policy that supports communities receiving refugees should acknowledge the challenges these communities face and ensure their needs are met. Observations in areas like the diocese of Canterbury in east Kent highlight the significant responsibilities these regions bear during refugee crises. An effective policy should confidently address misconceptions about those seeking help, avoiding assumptions that they are dishonest or exploitative. Such a policy is pragmatic and considers the effects on host communities, including the importance of managing the number of arrivals and ensuring safety and order. It should also focus on eliminating the illegal activities of people smugglers, a major global issue, and differentiate between individuals in need and those who exploit them.

A compassionate policy is one that has confidence to reject the shrill narratives that all who come to us for help should be treated as liars, scroungers or less than fully human. Compassion is not weakness or naivety. It recognises the impact on receiving communities, which includes the need to limit numbers and maintain security and order. Compassion means ending the criminal activity of people smugglers—perhaps one of the biggest industries in the world, after drug smuggling. It must distinguish between victims seeking help and criminals who exploit them.

The results of the Government’s failed deterrence policy have been disastrous for all parties except organised criminals, as the noble Lord, Lord Desai, pointed out.

Indeed, since 2015, we had trained more than 22,000 Ukrainians through Operation Orbital following the annexation of Crimea. As soon as Russian boots touched Ukrainian soil, we were again determined to lead the international response. The UK was the first European country to provide Ukraine with lethal aid to help stall the Russian advance.

10	3480	1,0	ukraine-russia	We must continue to provide military and economic support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia	Ours is a calibrated response—one that is necessitated by Russia’s growing aggression and indiscriminate bombing, but also intended to act as a force multiplier. The UK’s announcement generated unstoppable momentum, with countries following our lead to pledge main battle tanks to Ukraine. Germany’s decision to send Leopard 2 tanks and the United States’ to send Abrams tanks, coupled with the pledges of Poland, Spain, Canada and France, have enabled us to send a unified signal to Moscow that is more important than any individual contribution. It is a signal that says no one is acting unilaterally and that we are united in helping Ukraine to defend its land and evict the illegal invader.	Once again, I thank all noble Lords for their contributions. There is always more to say, but as my noble friend Lord Cormack quite rightly said, what more can be done? Given the time I have taken, I have perhaps indicated that a lot is being done. Mr Putin has a clear message being sent to him that the world stands united, and we will continue to do so. His disregard for international norms and laws is unacceptable. He will continue, I am sure, in his unprovoked, reckless and destabilising activity, but the ultimate objective must be to remove Russian forces from Ukraine, relinquish his illegal control of Ukrainian territory, and end his barbaric attacks against civilians. Until then, the Government are resolute—I know I speak for all noble Lords on this—and we will continue to support the brave people of Ukraine by ramping up diplomatic, economic and, yes, military pressure on Mr Putin and Russia. We will do all we can to bring about the end of Mr Putin’s invasion and ensure that in 2023 and beyond, Ukraine maintains its momentum, supported by the international community.

The discussion on this topic has been comprehensive, and as mentioned by my colleague, the question arises about further actions. It appears that significant measures are already in place. The international community is conveying a unified stance to Mr. Putin, indicating that his actions are inconsistent with accepted international standards. His activities in Ukraine are unwarranted and pose risks to stability, and the primary goal remains the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territories and the cessation of control over these areas. The government remains committed to this goal, and it is clear that there is a consensus on this matter. Support for Ukraine will continue through increased diplomatic, economic, and military measures against Mr. Putin's regime. The aim is to conclude the conflict and ensure that Ukraine continues to receive international support moving forward.

With hearts filled with resolve and a deep sense of justice, we stand united against Russia's relentless aggression and heartless bombing. Our response is not just strategic but a moral imperative, driven by the pain and suffering of the Ukrainian people. When the UK announced its support, it was a beacon of hope that inspired a powerful wave of solidarity. Countries like Germany, with their Leopard 2 tanks, and the United States, with their Abrams tanks, have joined in this noble cause alongside Poland, Spain, Canada, and France. Together, we send a resounding message to Moscow—a message of unity, courage, and the unwavering will to support Ukraine in reclaiming its rightful land and ousting the oppressive invader. This is more than just military aid; it is a testament to the strength of our shared humanity.

This is more than just military aid; it is a testament to the strength of our shared humanity.	The discussion on this topic has been comprehensive, and as mentioned by my colleague, the question arises about further actions. It appears that significant measures are already in place. The international community is conveying a unified stance to Mr. Putin, indicating that his actions are inconsistent with accepted international standards. His activities in Ukraine are unwarranted and pose risks to stability, and the primary goal remains the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territories and the cessation of control over these areas. The government remains committed to this goal, and it is clear that there is a consensus on this matter. Support for Ukraine will continue through increased diplomatic, economic, and military measures against Mr. Putin's regime. The aim is to conclude the conflict and ensure that Ukraine continues to receive international support moving forward.
182	3690	2,3	ukraine-russia	Russia's war in Ukraine has caused immense human suffering and numerous war crimes	Putin, with his cold and calculating demeanor, is surely realizing that his ambitions are slipping through his fingers, each day becoming an agonizing reminder of how wrong his initial calculations were. Yet, the chilling reality is that instead of retreating, he is fiercely clinging to his dangerous objectives, with a defiance that sends shivers down the spine. For the UK, it is not just a strategic necessity but a moral imperative to make sure that Putin's ruthless campaign is seen as a catastrophic failure. The world must feel the weight of this lesson: that such brazen attacks on international peace will shatter dreams and bring nothing but despair. But this is not enough. As I passionately declared alongside the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, the horrific violence in Ukraine is being driven by the heartless Wagner organization—a monstrous entity that thrives on terror, torture, murder, and rape. How can a world that calls itself civilised stand by while such evil flourishes? It is our duty to fight with every ounce of our strength to banish this darkness from the global stage.	Observing the developments of the 2014 conflict into a full-scale invasion of Ukraine from a hotel room in Baghdad, before traveling to Beirut, highlighted the broader implications of Russia's actions against an independent state. This unauthorized military intervention by Russia has had extensive repercussions beyond Ukraine's borders. According to the UN Human Rights Office, the conflict has resulted in more than 7,000 civilian fatalities, including 438 children. Additionally, it has adversely affected women. Furthermore, Russia's strategic manipulation of grain supplies has worsened food shortages in the Horn of Africa, where 5 million children are experiencing severe malnutrition, a topic recently discussed. The use of the Wagner Group to exert forceful measures in Africa further complicates the situation.

193	4426	2,3	ukraine-russia	We must continue to provide military and economic support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia	As we stand at a pivotal moment in history, the urgency to provide robust military support to Ukraine is palpable. Last month, the Defence Secretary unveiled our most substantial military aid package yet, igniting a spark of hope for Ukraine's future. The desperate need for heavier, cutting-edge equipment to hasten their victory is a matter of life and death. With the inclusion of fourteen mighty Challenger 2 tanks, a comprehensive training program, and powerful artillery, we are empowering Ukraine to not just resist, but to drive out the Russian forces that threaten their homeland. This courageous step has inspired our NATO allies—the United States, France, Canada, Poland, and Germany, among others—to rally behind us, offering their own main battle tanks to Ukraine. This heartening show of solidarity is a beacon of hope, and we fervently wish that it will galvanize additional support from other nations, reinforcing our collective commitment to Ukraine's freedom.	The discussion on this topic has been comprehensive, and as mentioned by my colleague, the question arises about further actions. It appears that significant measures are already in place. The international community is conveying a unified stance to Mr. Putin, indicating that his actions are inconsistent with accepted international standards. His activities in Ukraine are unwarranted and pose risks to stability, and the primary goal remains the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukrainian territories and the cessation of control over these areas. The government remains committed to this goal, and it is clear that there is a consensus on this matter. Support for Ukraine will continue through increased diplomatic, economic, and military measures against Mr. Putin's regime. The aim is to conclude the conflict and ensure that Ukraine continues to receive international support moving forward.

Ukraine urgently needs heavier, more modern equipment to expedite success. As many noble Lords alluded to, this package includes fourteen Challenger 2 tanks, a training package and artillery, which will further strengthen Ukraine’s capabilities. It means that, importantly, our Ukrainian friends can go from resisting to expelling Russian forces from Ukrainian soil. Our friends in NATO—the United States, France, Canada, Poland and Germany, among others—are following our lead and sending main battle tanks to Ukraine, which is a very important development. We hope that this combined effort will encourage further military support from other partners.

82	4426	0,2	ukraine-russia	We must continue to provide military and economic support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia	Once again, I thank all noble Lords for their contributions. There is always more to say, but as my noble friend Lord Cormack quite rightly said, what more can be done? Given the time I have taken, I have perhaps indicated that a lot is being done. Mr Putin has a clear message being sent to him that the world stands united, and we will continue to do so. His disregard for international norms and laws is unacceptable. He will continue, I am sure, in his unprovoked, reckless and destabilising activity, but the ultimate objective must be to remove Russian forces from Ukraine, relinquish his illegal control of Ukrainian territory, and end his barbaric attacks against civilians. Until then, the Government are resolute—I know I speak for all noble Lords on this—and we will continue to support the brave people of Ukraine by ramping up diplomatic, economic and, yes, military pressure on Mr Putin and Russia. We will do all we can to bring about the end of Mr Putin’s invasion and ensure that in 2023 and beyond, Ukraine maintains its momentum, supported by the international community.	As we stand at a pivotal moment in history, the urgency to provide robust military support to Ukraine is palpable. Last month, the Defence Secretary unveiled our most substantial military aid package yet, igniting a spark of hope for Ukraine's future. The desperate need for heavier, cutting-edge equipment to hasten their victory is a matter of life and death. With the inclusion of fourteen mighty Challenger 2 tanks, a comprehensive training program, and powerful artillery, we are empowering Ukraine to not just resist, but to drive out the Russian forces that threaten their homeland. This courageous step has inspired our NATO allies—the United States, France, Canada, Poland, and Germany, among others—to rally behind us, offering their own main battle tanks to Ukraine. This heartening show of solidarity is a beacon of hope, and we fervently wish that it will galvanize additional support from other nations, reinforcing our collective commitment to Ukraine's freedom.
18	4426	1,0	ukraine-russia	We must continue to provide military and economic support to Ukraine in its fight against Russia	I turn now to how we will ensure we are providing enough military support. Last month, my right honourable friend the Defence Secretary announced our most significant military support package to date. Ukraine urgently needs heavier, more modern equipment to expedite success. As many noble Lords alluded to, this package includes fourteen Challenger 2 tanks, a training package and artillery, which will further strengthen Ukraine’s capabilities. It means that, importantly, our Ukrainian friends can go from resisting to expelling Russian forces from Ukrainian soil. Our friends in NATO—the United States, France, Canada, Poland and Germany, among others—are following our lead and sending main battle tanks to Ukraine, which is a very important development. We hope that this combined effort will encourage further military support from other partners.	Once again, I thank all noble Lords for their contributions. There is always more to say, but as my noble friend Lord Cormack quite rightly said, what more can be done? Given the time I have taken, I have perhaps indicated that a lot is being done. Mr Putin has a clear message being sent to him that the world stands united, and we will continue to do so. His disregard for international norms and laws is unacceptable. He will continue, I am sure, in his unprovoked, reckless and destabilising activity, but the ultimate objective must be to remove Russian forces from Ukraine, relinquish his illegal control of Ukrainian territory, and end his barbaric attacks against civilians. Until then, the Government are resolute—I know I speak for all noble Lords on this—and we will continue to support the brave people of Ukraine by ramping up diplomatic, economic and, yes, military pressure on Mr Putin and Russia. We will do all we can to bring about the end of Mr Putin’s invasion and ensure that in 2023 and beyond, Ukraine maintains its momentum, supported by the international community.
48	4985	0,1	ukraine-russia	 Russia is responsible for committing acts of sexual violence and the abduction of children during the war in Ukraine	One of the areas I have particularly been working on are the crimes which have involved sexual violence against women and children, but also against young men, and the abduction of children. I want this House to know that, before warrants were issued by the International Criminal Court, evidence was being accrued. It was so alarming that, here in the United Kingdom, we placed the woman who is the head of the Russian commission on children, who was very active and behind much of the strategy of taking children into Russia, on a sanctions list some months before the warrants were issued by the International Criminal Court. Therefore, Britain was alert to all of this and took important steps to sanction her.	This is not the first time Russia has targeted children. Similar practices were deployed in 2014 with the so-called “Train of Hope”. The international community failed to address those crimes in 2014, and President Zelensky is right to demand that we do not do the same again. On 17 March, a pre-trial chamber of the International Criminal Court issued warrants of arrest for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova  “for the war crime of unlawful deportation of population and that of unlawful transfer of population from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation”.  “War crimes”—not a rhetorical device but an indictment. The International Criminal Court goes further, saying:  “There are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Putin and Ms. Lvova-Belova bear individual criminal responsibility for these crimes”.    This week Mr. Zelensky said:  “Never before the mass kidnapping and deportation would become a part of the government policy. Not until now. We know the names of tens of thousands of children and have evidence on hundreds of thousands of others kidnapped by Russia in the occupied territories of Ukraine and later deported. … We are trying to get children back home but time goes by. What will happen to them? Those children in Russia are taught to hate Ukraine, and all ties with their families are broken … This is clearly a genocide. When hatred is weaponized against one nation, it never stops there”.

On 17 March, the International Criminal Court took a bold stand, issuing arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, accusing them of the devastating war crime of tearing families apart through the unlawful deportation and transfer of Ukrainian children. These are not mere words—they are a piercing indictment of inhumanity. The ICC's declaration that Putin and Lvova-Belova bear individual responsibility for these atrocities sends a chilling message.

When we see the innocent lives taken that day, we pray for those souls. I know that people of all faiths and none were shocked by the inhumanity of the brutal murder of so many innocent people in Israel. Therefore, we should, irrespective of faith, community, belief and religion, condemn unequivocally the terror attacks committed by Hamas against Israel and, indeed, many international citizens. Simply put, these attacks were driven by hatred.	It is infuriating to see parts of our own media cower in fear, refusing to label Hamas as the terrorist organization it is, instead choosing to sanitize their actions by calling them “militants” or “fighters.” This is not just a matter of semantics; it is a gross injustice that creates a false sense of moral parity between Hamas and Israel’s armed forces, which is utterly unacceptable. When the hospital in Gaza was bombed, the world’s news media were swift to point fingers at Israel, fueling outrage and condemnation. Yet, as independent sources and government agencies diligently uncovered the truth, it became heartbreakingly clear that the missile was launched from within Gaza itself, causing the tragic loss of hundreds of innocent Palestinian lives. Despite this devastating revelation, Hamas shamelessly exploited this catastrophe to incite anti-Israeli sentiment worldwide. Even with irrefutable evidence, the narrative of blame remains stubbornly unchanged, a painful reminder of how easily truth can be overshadowed by propaganda.

Many individuals globally maintain the position that Israel was responsible for the violent events, or they attempt to downplay the severity of the acts committed by those who entered Israel with harmful intentions towards civilians. It is important to address this misinformation. The fact remains that a significant number of armed Hamas members entered Israeli villages, resulting in substantial harm and loss. They documented their actions, which included violent acts against civilians. Despite this, some people still attempt to rationalize these actions.

They bound, gagged and riddled with bullet holes the bodies of young and old. Hamas celebrated the beheading of men, women, children and babies, and yet there are those within our society who seek to justify these actions.	It is infuriating to see parts of our own media cower in fear, refusing to label Hamas as the terrorist organization it is, instead choosing to sanitize their actions by calling them “militants” or “fighters.” This is not just a matter of semantics; it is a gross injustice that creates a false sense of moral parity between Hamas and Israel’s armed forces, which is utterly unacceptable. When the hospital in Gaza was bombed, the world’s news media were swift to point fingers at Israel, fueling outrage and condemnation. Yet, as independent sources and government agencies diligently uncovered the truth, it became heartbreakingly clear that the missile was launched from within Gaza itself, causing the tragic loss of hundreds of innocent Palestinian lives. Despite this devastating revelation, Hamas shamelessly exploited this catastrophe to incite anti-Israeli sentiment worldwide. Even with irrefutable evidence, the narrative of blame remains stubbornly unchanged, a painful reminder of how easily truth can be overshadowed by propaganda.
147	5282	1,3	israel	Israel has been falsely blamed for the murder of civilians by Hamas	Even parts of our own media are afraid to call out Hamas as a terrorist organisation and content to call its murderers “militants” or “fighters”. There is absolutely no excuse for creating the impression of a moral equivalence between Hamas and Israel’s armed forces. When the hospital was bombed in Gaza the world’s news media were quick to blame Israel but, when independent sources as well as government agencies researched the evidence, this was found to be totally untrue. The blast at the hospital was from a missile fired in Gaza and hundreds of Palestinians paid the price with their innocent lives, yet Hamas used this tragedy to stir up anti-Israeli hatred across the world and, even after evidence has been produced to the contrary, the narrative has not changed.	Many individuals globally maintain the position that Israel was responsible for the violent events, or they attempt to downplay the severity of the acts committed by those who entered Israel with harmful intentions towards civilians. It is important to address this misinformation. The fact remains that a significant number of armed Hamas members entered Israeli villages, resulting in substantial harm and loss. They documented their actions, which included violent acts against civilians. Despite this, some people still attempt to rationalize these actions.
29	5298	0,1	israel	Hamas’s terror attacks are brutal and must be condemned	Let me make it clear that those who claim that the Hamas gunmen were soldiers fighting for a just cause are totally deceived. They were evil assassins who murdered the elderly, disabled, children and babies; they raped women, even abusing a dead young woman’s body, having been instructed to kill anyone and everyone. The inhumanity of their actions is unbelievable yet true and it must be condemned by all. Noble Lords may ask how such inhumanity could happen in 2023. Hamas’s stated aim is the obliteration or annihilation of Israel, not peaceful co-existence with Israel. Its actions are therefore taken seeking to achieve its evil ends.

The extent of their actions is significant and should be universally denounced. It is reasonable to question how such actions could occur in 2023. Hamas's declared objective is the elimination of Israel, rather than peaceful coexistence with the nation. Consequently, its actions are aimed at achieving these objectives.

As we have heard in this debate, despite those events two weeks ago, Israel is still under attack, with rockets still being fired over it and launched against it. Israel has the right and, indeed, the duty to bring home all hostages being held by Hamas and to weaken the capabilities which made Black Saturday possible. A military response from Israel is justified in these circumstances, and it must be within those sacred parameters of international law and the protection of human life.

A military response by Israel is warranted under these conditions, provided it adheres to international law and prioritizes the protection of human life. As Keir Starmer has noted, democracies uphold the principle that all human lives are of equal value, and it is crucial to protect innocent lives, distinguishing democratic actions from those of groups targeting Israel.

7	6014	1,0	refugee	The Rwanda scheme would fail to deter criminal traffickers	This Bill, and the deal behind it, will do nothing to stop boats coming to our shores. The Government’s plan hinges on the idea that the Rwanda scheme presents a deterrent effect, without presenting any evidence that this will be the case.  It is certainly difficult to imagine what deterrent effect a 1% or 2% chance of being sent to Rwanda would have. It is even more difficult to imagine why this would stop criminal traffickers; nor would the Bill present those fleeing conflict and persecution with safe alternatives to channel crossings. Last summer, the Government committed to publishing a report detailing existing and proposed additional safe and legal routes. A report has arrived, but it contains no proposals for creating safe routes for those seeking asylum. Can we assume, then, that the Government’s additional pledge to implement any proposed new routes by the end of this year is to be broken too? This was an issue raised repeatedly in both Houses during the passage of the then Illegal Migration Bill, and it is disappointing that the Government have not taken the request seriously.	So we are now expected to send a woman trafficked by a British gang, who arrived undocumented and cannot even claim that she has been trafficked here in the UK, to another country which will somehow operate a system which the TIP report has said does not even meet minimum standards.  Before I close, I will pick up on the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, about the UK’s characterisation of Rwanda and how we are seeing our relationship through the lens of vilification and ignoring development partnership. Well, it is the Government who say that being sent to Rwanda is a deterrent, not the Opposition. Even before the MoU was agreed, I raised my alarm in this Chamber that the Government had slashed development partnership support from £85 million in 2018 to less than £16 million. Now the financial partnership relationship with the Government of Rwanda is almost exclusively around migration. This relationship with Rwanda is being seen through the Government’s lens, not ours, and I regret that.

The Government’s plan hinges on the idea that the Rwanda scheme presents a deterrent effect, without presenting any evidence that this will be the case.  It is certainly difficult to imagine what deterrent effect a 1% or 2% chance of being sent to Rwanda would have. It is even more difficult to imagine why this would stop criminal traffickers; nor would the Bill present those fleeing conflict and persecution with safe alternatives to channel crossings. Last summer, the Government committed to publishing a report detailing existing and proposed additional safe and legal routes. A report has arrived, but it contains no proposals for creating safe routes for those seeking asylum. Can we assume, then, that the Government’s additional pledge to implement any proposed new routes by the end of this year is to be broken too? This was an issue raised repeatedly in both Houses during the passage of the then Illegal Migration Bill, and it is disappointing that the Government have not taken the request seriously.	The current situation involves the potential deportation of an undocumented woman, trafficked by a British gang, to a country whose system, as indicated by the TIP report, fails to meet basic standards. Additionally, the UK Government has characterized its relationship with Rwanda in terms of deterrence rather than development partnership. This is evident from the reduction in development support from £85 million in 2018 to under £16 million. The financial interactions with Rwanda now primarily focus on migration, reflecting the Government's perspective rather than an emphasis on broader partnership.
94	6014	0,2	refugee	The Rwanda scheme would fail to deter criminal traffickers	So we are now expected to send a woman trafficked by a British gang, who arrived undocumented and cannot even claim that she has been trafficked here in the UK, to another country which will somehow operate a system which the TIP report has said does not even meet minimum standards.  Before I close, I will pick up on the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, about the UK’s characterisation of Rwanda and how we are seeing our relationship through the lens of vilification and ignoring development partnership. Well, it is the Government who say that being sent to Rwanda is a deterrent, not the Opposition. Even before the MoU was agreed, I raised my alarm in this Chamber that the Government had slashed development partnership support from £85 million in 2018 to less than £16 million. Now the financial partnership relationship with the Government of Rwanda is almost exclusively around migration. This relationship with Rwanda is being seen through the Government’s lens, not ours, and I regret that.	This Bill, along with the deal supporting it, is a misguided attempt that will utterly fail to prevent the arrival of boats on our shores. The Government’s reliance on the Rwanda scheme as a deterrent is baffling and lacks any compelling evidence to back it up. How can we possibly believe that a mere 1% or 2% chance of being sent to Rwanda will dissuade desperate individuals? It’s disheartening to consider that this will do nothing to impede ruthless criminal traffickers. Moreover, the Bill offers no compassion or humanity by failing to provide those fleeing war and persecution with safe alternatives to perilous channel crossings. Last summer, the Government made a solemn promise to deliver a report on safe and legal routes, yet the report we received was devoid of any meaningful proposals. Are we now to face the crushing disappointment of another broken promise regarding the implementation of new routes by year’s end? It is infuriating that such a critical issue, highlighted repeatedly during the passage of the then Illegal Migration Bill, has been brushed aside with such indifference by the Government.

23	6157	1,0	refugee	Rwanda is not a safe haven for refugees and cannot be relied upon to protect their rights	The Government have said that the treaty addresses the Supreme Court’s concerns but are now asking us to bar the Supreme Court from judging whether it does. These Benches reject that. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Stewart, said at the start that the Supreme Court used out-of-date information when it came to its judgment, but we know, and he knows, that the Supreme Court gave considerable weight to the UNHCR, which just this month concluded again that the UK-Rwanda arrangements are  “incompatible with the letter and spirit of the 1951 Convention”.  The Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law told us that, fundamentally,  “Safety is a factual question which cannot be conclusively determined in advance, for all cases, by the legislature. Enacting a conclusive deeming of Rwanda as a safe country is a legislative usurpation of the judicial function”.    We agree.	So we are now expected to send a woman trafficked by a British gang, who arrived undocumented and cannot even claim that she has been trafficked here in the UK, to another country which will somehow operate a system which the TIP report has said does not even meet minimum standards.

The Government claims that the treaty resolves the Supreme Court's concerns, yet they now attempt to strip the Court of its power to assess this claim. This is utterly unacceptable. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Stewart, argued that the Supreme Court relied on outdated information, but both he and we are fully aware that the Court placed significant importance on the UNHCR's assessment. Just this month, the UNHCR reaffirmed that the UK-Rwanda arrangements blatantly violate the essence of the 1951 Convention. This is a grave concern. The Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law has highlighted that determining safety is a matter of fact, not something that can be predetermined for all cases by the legislature. To declare Rwanda as a safe country through legislation is a blatant overreach of legislative power, undermining the judiciary's role. This is deeply troubling, and we stand firmly against it.

103	6200	1,3	refugee	Rwanda is not a safe haven for refugees and cannot be relied upon to protect their rights	The claim made by the Government is that we have entered into an agreement with Rwanda that says it will not send anybody who comes from here to anywhere except the UK, to which the answer is that given by the international treaties committee: that the reason there was a risk of refoulement was that Rwanda did not even have the most basic system of properly assessing asylum claims. The idea that the Bill envisages—that the moment the new treaty comes into force, it will provide that protection—is absolute nonsense. Everybody appreciates that except, as far as I can see, the right honourable Mr James Cleverly, the Secretary of State for Home Affairs. If we look at the conclusions that the Supreme Court introduced, we see that, factually, it is just a non-starter.	The Bill raises two issues. For seven decades, the country has maintained a policy against deporting asylum seekers to locations where they could potentially face severe harm. This policy allows asylum seekers to request judicial protection if they perceive such a threat. Although courts may dismiss cases lacking merit, this protective measure has been part of our legal framework since the Human Rights Act 1998. The Bill suggests the possibility, or even the likelihood, as per independent analyses, that individuals could be transferred to Rwanda, where there is a significant chance of them being returned to countries where they might face torture or death.
14	6200	0,1	refugee	Rwanda is not a safe haven for refugees and cannot be relied upon to protect their rights	I have two concerns about the Bill. As a nation, we have accepted for the last 70 years that we will not deport asylum seekers to a place where they may face death, torture or inhuman treatment, and that, if asylum seekers feel that that is a risk, they can seek protection from the courts. The courts may well give an applicant short shrift if they do not think there is anything in it, but we have stood by that protection for 70 years and incorporated it into our domestic law in the Human Rights Act 1998. The Bill envisages the possibility—or indeed it being the more-likely-than-not result, according to those who have looked at it independently—that people will be sent to Rwanda, where they will be at substantial risk of being refouled, which means sent back to a place where they could be tortured or killed.	The claim made by the Government is that we have entered into an agreement with Rwanda that says it will not send anybody who comes from here to anywhere except the UK, to which the answer is that given by the international treaties committee: that the reason there was a risk of refoulement was that Rwanda did not even have the most basic system of properly assessing asylum claims.

169	6200	2,3	refugee	Rwanda is not a safe haven for refugees and cannot be relied upon to protect their rights	The Government's claim that we've struck a deal with Rwanda, ensuring no one sent there will end up anywhere but the UK, is deeply troubling.

The notion that this new treaty will magically fix these issues is pure fantasy. It's baffling that everyone seems to understand this, except for Mr. James Cleverly, the Secretary of State for Home Affairs, who appears blind to the harsh reality.

Imagine the heartbreak of those who have risked everything, fleeing war and persecution, only to find themselves in Rwanda, their hopes dashed. They stand shoulder to shoulder with others who haven't been recognized as refugees, sharing the same uncertain fate. It's a cruel twist of fate that those who have proven their need for asylum, recognized by every international standard, find themselves trapped in the same predicament as those denied refugee status. The only glimmer of hope lies for those who claim asylum as Rwandans in the UK or those who cannot return to their homeland due to danger, allowed back under the Bill. This situation is like a maddening, surreal nightmare, akin to Alice in Wonderland, where logic and justice seem to have vanished.
