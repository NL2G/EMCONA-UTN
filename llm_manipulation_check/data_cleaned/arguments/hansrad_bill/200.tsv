1	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	3,1	My Lords, I acknowledge the contributions of the 14 noble Lords and noble Baronesses who provided insightful and constructive feedback, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Young, for acknowledging my appointment and my first Bill. The Bill aims to terminate the export of livestock and horses for slaughter and fattening, thereby eliminating the need for these journeys. It demonstrates our commitment to enhancing welfare standards for animals and reinforces our position as leaders on this issue. Various animal welfare organizations and parliamentarians have advocated for this ban on live exports, and there is substantial public support for this initiative. There is a clear consensus on the necessity to stop these journeys.	Many animal welfare groups have called for this ban on live exports. We have heard support for the Bill from Government Members. May I put on record my acknowledgement of the KALE—Kent Against Live Exports—group, which has done an enormous amount of campaigning on the issue, working with my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Craig Mackinlay), who cannot be in his place today, and other colleagues across the House? We know that there is huge public support for the ban, as evidenced by the flood of respondents to our consultation, 87% of whom agreed on the need for the ban on exports for slaughter and fattening. There is clearly broad recognition that we must end these unnecessary journeys, and we are taking the opportunity to do that.

13	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	0,2	The Conservative Government have a strong record on animal welfare. I agree that it should not be a party-political issue. The Government have passed the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022; created the Animal Sentience Committee so that every piece of legislation must have due regard to animal sentience, which is so important; passed the Sentencing Act 2020 to increase the penalties for cruelty to animals; and brought in the compulsory microchipping of cats. Just last week, we talked about banning the keeping of primates as pets. As we have heard, individual Bills such as today’s are being introduced, as well as private Member’s Bills to tackle pet theft, pet smuggling and puppy smuggling, and to stop the import of dogs that have had their ears horrifically cropped, of cats that have had their claws horrifically taken off them, and of heavily pregnant cats and dogs. Those Bills are being introduced, as is another on livestock worrying.	Many compassionate animal welfare groups have passionately advocated for this much-needed ban on live exports.

13	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	3,1	The Conservative Government has enacted several measures to address animal welfare. This includes the passage of the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022, which led to the formation of the Animal Sentience Committee to ensure legislation considers animal sentience. The Sentencing Act 2020 was also passed to increase penalties for animal cruelty, and mandatory microchipping for cats has been implemented.

25	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	0,2	This Bill is supported not just by my constituents, but by industry representatives across Norfolk and the UK more widely. I do not think that anyone has mentioned that the National Farmers Union supports it as well, as does the RSPCA. Although it is great that we will no longer see the fattening and slaughter of animals transported overseas, which will be outlawed—it is great that we have not seen that since 2021—it is also important that we get on and pass this legislation swiftly through Parliament, and put it permanently into practice. I will have particular pride when residents come up to me and say, “Name me a benefit of Brexit,” because I can now turn round and say there is yet another one. This legislation is only possible because we have been able to take back control and sovereignty of our lawmaking. By doing away with decision making being bound by the European Union’s animal transport laws, we have been able to introduce this Bill.

36	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	1,3	We have seen the number of live animal exports decrease significantly over recent decades. Since 2020, there have been no recorded exports for slaughter or fattening from Great Britain to the EU. However, the demand from Europe’s slaughterhouses for British livestock, especially sheep, remains. The Bill will ensure that this trade cannot resume.   There is a clear rationale for the Bill. The shortest direct-to-slaughter export journey from Great Britain to continental Europe in 2018 took 18 hours. Most domestic journeys to slaughter in the UK are significantly shorter. Journeys of unweaned calves from Great Britain for fattening in Spain were found to last on average 60 hours.	As noted by Lady Young of Old Scone, long-distance live animal transport can negatively affect animal welfare. Animals may face issues such as physical injuries, temperature stress, hunger, dehydration, and exhaustion. Overcrowding during export can prevent animals from lying down, and those that manage to do so may risk injury. Different species are affected differently; for instance, pigs can suffer from motion sickness, even on short trips. Newly weaned piglets are particularly susceptible to temperature fluctuations compared to older animals. It is relevant to consider the role of abattoir closures, as mentioned by Lord Trees, which have contributed to longer travel distances for animals domestically.
36	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	0,2	As my noble friend Lady Young of Old Scone said, animal welfare can be compromised during long-distance live travel. Animals can experience a range of problems, such as physical injury, hot or cold stress, hunger, hydration and exhaustion, and during export overcrowding means that some cannot lie down at all, while those who do may be injured or trampled. Different animals suffer in different ways. For example, pigs can become very travel sick, even on very short journeys. Newly weaned piglets are more vulnerable than older animals, particularly to temperature changes, so I was very pleased that noble Lords—particularly the noble Lord, Lord Trees—talked about the closure of abattoirs and how that has increased travel distances for animals on our own shores.	The heart-wrenching reality of live animal exports is a story that has seen some positive change over recent decades, as the number of these exports has dwindled. Since 2020, there have been no recorded exports for slaughter or fattening from Great Britain to the EU, a fact that should fill us with relief. Yet, the haunting demand from Europe's slaughterhouses for British livestock, especially our beloved sheep, persists. This Bill is a beacon of hope, ensuring that this painful trade cannot start again. Imagine the agony these animals endure; the shortest direct-to-slaughter export journey from Great Britain to continental Europe in 2018 took a harrowing 18 hours. Most domestic journeys to slaughter in the UK are mercifully shorter. The thought of unweaned calves suffering through an average 60-hour journey from Great Britain for fattening in Spain is unbearable. This Bill stands as a compassionate barrier against such cruelty.

47	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	3,2	I am not going to commend the Minister on introducing this Bill, primarily because it prompts us to question the delay in its presentation. The Conservatives included this issue in their 2017 manifesto and highlighted it during the 2019 general election, promising to use Brexit to implement animal welfare measures. However, it is only now, towards the end of 2023, that we see the Bill being introduced. The necessity of this protection is clear. Members have detailed the unnecessary suffering involved in the live export of animals, and Ministers have acknowledged issues such as stress, injuries, and trauma for animals. They are often transported to destinations where conditions are worse than those in UK abattoirs, with risks of starvation and death during transit. This legislation is undeniably required.	The heart-wrenching reality of live animal exports is a story that has seen some positive change over recent decades, as the number of these exports has dwindled. Since 2020, there have been no recorded exports for slaughter or fattening from Great Britain to the EU, a fact that should fill us with relief.

I am not going to congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill, first because we should ask: why has it taken so long? The Conservatives had this issue in their manifesto in 2017, they boasted in the 2019 general election that they would use Brexit freedoms to bring in animal welfare measures, and now, at the end of 2023, we are finally seeing a Bill emerge. There is no doubt about the need for this protection. Members have outlined the undue and unnecessary suffering involved in the live export of animals, and Ministers have made reference to it—whether it is the stress, injuries and trauma for animals; the fact that they are taken to destinations where they are often treated far worse than they would be in abattoirs here in the United Kingdom; the starvation, or the fact that many animals die during those journeys. Of course this is a necessary piece of legislation.

However, the demand from Europe’s slaughterhouses for British livestock, especially sheep, remains. The Bill will ensure that this trade cannot resume.   There is a clear rationale for the Bill. The shortest direct-to-slaughter export journey from Great Britain to continental Europe in 2018 took 18 hours. Most domestic journeys to slaughter in the UK are significantly shorter. Journeys of unweaned calves from Great Britain for fattening in Spain were found to last on average 60 hours.	I am not going to commend the Minister on introducing this Bill, primarily because it prompts us to question the delay in its presentation. The Conservatives included this issue in their 2017 manifesto and highlighted it during the 2019 general election, promising to use Brexit to implement animal welfare measures. However, it is only now, towards the end of 2023, that we see the Bill being introduced. The necessity of this protection is clear. Members have detailed the unnecessary suffering involved in the live export of animals, and Ministers have acknowledged issues such as stress, injuries, and trauma for animals. They are often transported to destinations where conditions are worse than those in UK abattoirs, with risks of starvation and death during transit. This legislation is undeniably required.

I am not going to congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill, first because we should ask: why has it taken so long? The Conservatives had this issue in their manifesto in 2017, they boasted in the 2019 general election that they would use Brexit freedoms to bring in animal welfare measures, and now, at the end of 2023, we are finally seeing a Bill emerge. There is no doubt about the need for this protection. Members have outlined the undue and unnecessary suffering involved in the live export of animals, and Ministers have made reference to it—whether it is the stress, injuries and trauma for animals; the fact that they are taken to destinations where they are often treated far worse than they would be in abattoirs here in the United Kingdom; the starvation, or the fact that many animals die during those journeys. Of course this is a necessary piece of legislation.
85	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	1,0	It is crucial to re-emphasise that this legislation is not just about animal welfare; it is about our identity as a society and the values and compassions that we have for ethical treatment. The call for a ban on live exports is not an isolated action, but part of a broader movement for change. Public support for a ban is overwhelming, as has been demonstrated by the many petitions calling on the UK Government to take the kept animals Bill through Parliament. It is crucial to be clear that the ban, as proposed, will apply only to exports for fattening and slaughter from, or through, the United Kingdom. It explicitly excludes the export of breeding animals, recognising their vital role in Scotland’s agricultural sector.	I recently visited Oak Wood School in Hillingdon, which was hosting a Christmas fair for students with special educational needs that involved interaction with animals. Such interaction not only supports education, but significantly enhances the wellbeing and confidence of young people. The people of Uxbridge and South Ruislip are huge animal lovers. No one could go far in my constituency without spotting many dog walkers enjoying the wonderous open and green spaces that are part of one of London’s greenest constituencies. My inbox is often full not just with campaign emails, but with genuine heartfelt messages that touch on all elements of animal welfare. That has been especially the case over the past couple of weeks, as residents have echoed my feeling in support of the Bill. Indeed, more than 85% of the 11,000 respondents to the Department’s consultation on live exports agreed with the measures in the Bill.

The push for a ban on live exports is not merely a policy decision; it is a reflection of our collective conscience and moral responsibility. The overwhelming public support, evident in numerous heartfelt petitions, showcases the deep-rooted desire for change and a more humane world. People are passionately urging the UK Government to pass the kept animals Bill through Parliament, as it symbolizes a step towards a kinder future. The proposed ban specifically targets exports for fattening and slaughter, ensuring that breeding animals, crucial to Scotland’s agricultural heritage, are safeguarded.

This is a powerful testament to our humanity and our willingness to protect those who cannot speak for themselves. The Scottish Animal Welfare Commission and the UK Animal Welfare Committee have united in this mission, not only focusing on transportation but also tackling heart-wrenching issues like avian influenza, the cruel culling of male chicks, and the ethical concerns of fur sourcing.

We know that there is huge public support for the ban, as evidenced by the flood of respondents to our consultation, 87% of whom agreed on the need for the ban on exports for slaughter and fattening. There is clearly broad recognition that we must end these unnecessary journeys, and we are taking the opportunity to do that.	Certainly. Labour Front-Bench Members have consistently made that point, as have the hon.

The majority of people think the Government has a responsibility to protect animals from unnecessary suffering. Protecting the most vulnerable, including animals, is a primary role of the state.

This change is a heartfelt opportunity made possible by the UK's departure from the EU, a chance to prioritize the welfare of animals in a way that wasn't possible before. While animals stand to gain from this new legislation, we must also ensure that our farmers, who have dedicated their lives to nurturing these animals, receive the support they need to thrive. The reduction in farm animal exports, a once vibrant part of our meat industry, is a stark reminder of the challenges posed by the absence of EU border control posts, as highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Carrington.

This proposed legislation can only happen due to the UK leaving the EU. Animals are certainly benefiting from this legislation, but we need to ensure the farming industry as a whole benefits too.

We really are a nation of animal lovers, as many have said, and a significant majority think that the Government have a clear responsibility to protect innocent and vulnerable animals from unnecessary suffering. It is indeed one of the main roles of the state to protect the most vulnerable in our society, and that must include animals. The Government’s track record on animal welfare, which did indeed once look promising, is now in tatters, but we are relieved that at least some progress is being made in the form of this ban on live exports. As my colleague stated at the outset of the debate, we will support the Bill and look forward to its being signed into law at very long last.
130	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	3,2	Certainly. Labour Front-Bench Members have consistently made that point, as have the hon. Member’s predecessor and other Government Members, including former Secretaries of State who are now able to express their views freely. These issues are important because the British public is concerned about animal welfare. Various polls have shown this, with a recent one indicating that over two-thirds of respondents believe that more should be done to enhance animal welfare and prevent cruelty. The majority of people think the Government has a responsibility to protect animals from unnecessary suffering. Protecting the most vulnerable, including animals, is a primary role of the state. While the Government's previous record on animal welfare seemed promising, it has now faltered. Nonetheless, some progress is evident with the ban on live exports. As mentioned at the start of the debate, we will support the Bill and anticipate its eventual enactment.	Supporting local abattoirs is not just a matter of logistics; it's about compassion and respect for the animals that provide for us. By keeping transport distances short, we reduce the stress and discomfort these creatures experience in their final moments. This change is a heartfelt opportunity made possible by the UK's departure from the EU, a chance to prioritize the welfare of animals in a way that wasn't possible before. While animals stand to gain from this new legislation, we must also ensure that our farmers, who have dedicated their lives to nurturing these animals, receive the support they need to thrive. The reduction in farm animal exports, a once vibrant part of our meat industry, is a stark reminder of the challenges posed by the absence of EU border control posts, as highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Carrington. It's time to address these issues with empathy and ensure a sustainable future for both our animals and our farmers.

As mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Hodgson, the support of local abattoirs is essential to keep the transport distance down to minimum for animals due for slaughter. This proposed legislation can only happen due to the UK leaving the EU. Animals are certainly benefiting from this legislation, but we need to ensure the farming industry as a whole benefits too. The export of farm animals was a minor but significant part of the fresh and frozen meat sector, and the only reason it has reduced is the lack of EU border control posts, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Carrington.
223	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	0,1	I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.   The Animal Welfare (Livestock Exports) Bill before us today will cement our position as a world leader on animal welfare. It will ban from Great Britain the export of cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and horses for slaughter and fattening, putting a permanent end to this unnecessary trade. I am proud to say that we are a nation of animal lovers. We have some of the highest animal welfare standards in the world and we continue to strengthen them. Indeed, the UK was the first country in the world to pass legislation to protect animals and we are currently joint top of the world animal protection index. The Bill builds on our proud record by preventing the unnecessary journeys of animals being exported abroad for slaughter.	My final point is that a key reason why some farmers have in the past sent non-breeding exports across the channel is that those 31 miles are closer than the nearest abattoir in the UK, due to the number of abattoir closures, which has already been highlighted by the noble Baronesses, Lady Fookes and Lady Hodgson, and my noble friend Lord Trees. It is estimated that number has reduced by one-third since 2014, including McIntyre Meats last week in the Prime Minister’s constituency. The unfortunate consequence is that some farmers undertake 200-mile journeys to abattoirs in the UK. While the Government’s smaller abattoir fund with £4 million available is a step in the right direction, it is unfortunately not enough, as was eloquently put by the honourable Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale when he said that it would   “not even touch the sides”—[ , Commons, 18/12/23; col. 1187.]   of his constituency, let alone the country as a whole.

223	A Bill to Prohibit the export of certain livestock from Great Britain for slaughter.	2,3	My final point is that the heart-wrenching reason some farmers have resorted to sending non-breeding exports across the channel is the unbearable distance of 31 miles, which is far less than the nearest abattoir in the UK. This is a direct result of the painful number of abattoir closures, as passionately highlighted by the noble Baronesses, Lady Fookes and Lady Hodgson, and my noble friend Lord Trees. Since 2014, it is devastating to note that the number has diminished by one-third, including the closure of McIntyre Meats last week in the Prime Minister’s constituency.

226	A Bill to create offences of dog abduction and cat abduction and to confer a power to make corresponding provision relating to the abduction of other animals commonly kept as pets.	3,2	I propose that the Bill be read a Second time. In the UK, there is a strong cultural appreciation for animals. Pets are often considered as integral members of households. They provide companionship and contribute to the daily lives of their owners. Consequently, when a pet is taken or abducted, it is considered a serious offense, as it disrupts the household and violates personal property rights.	The Bill is a beacon of hope for pet owners, introducing strong defenses of lawful authority and reasonable excuse, but what truly sets it apart are the severe penalties it imposes. Imagine the relief of knowing that the abduction of our cherished companions will be met with up to five years in prison, a punishment that echoes the gravity of animal welfare offences under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and the Welfare of Animals (Northern Ireland) Act 2011. This legislation sends a powerful message that our furry friends' safety is a priority. Currently, the Bill embraces our beloved cats and dogs, but it holds the potential to extend its loving arms to other species should the need arise. While it applies to England and Northern Ireland, there's a heartfelt hope that the devolved Governments will take inspiration and enact similar laws, ensuring that this essential measure of compassion and protection envelops our entire nation.

Britain is a nation of animal lovers. Our pets are part of our families. They comfort us when we are down and give us a huge amount of laughter, energy and joy when we are up—and, in fact, all the time. They make a house a home. That is why it is so heartbreaking when any one of our beloved pets is snatched away from us, and it is also why the taking, abducting or detaining of someone else’s beloved pet is such a sick and cruel crime.	The Bill includes defences of lawful authority and reasonable excuse. It also introduces tough penalties of a fine and/or up to five years in prison, a term which is comparable with provisions for animal welfare offences under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and the Welfare of Animals (Northern Ireland) Act 2011. The sanctions will lay down a vital marker that the abduction of beloved pets will be punished appropriately. At the moment, the Bill covers only cats and dogs, but there are enabling powers in it so that it can be amended to cover other species of animals if the need arises. The Bill applies to England and Northern Ireland only, as these issues are quite rightly matters for the devolved Governments. I hope they will implement similar legislation, so that this crucial animal welfare measure covers the whole of our country.

238	A Bill to create offences of dog abduction and cat abduction and to confer a power to make corresponding provision relating to the abduction of other animals commonly kept as pets.	3,2	The current legal framework inadequately addresses the issue of pet theft, as the penalties often do not match the seriousness of the act. The proposed Bill aims to rectify this by establishing pet abduction as a distinct offence. This change would serve as a deterrent to potential offenders by imposing more severe penalties, thereby reducing the likelihood of such crimes. By doing so, the Bill seeks to enhance the legal protection of pets and ensure that crimes against them are taken seriously.	At the outset, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all my colleagues who passionately participated in the debate, which has been nothing short of inspiring, showcasing a deep well of knowledge, expertise, and genuine affection for our beloved pets. We've witnessed an incredible show of unity, with the hon. Members for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy) and for West Ham (Ms Brown) joining hands across party lines. I sincerely thank them for their unwavering support. I also want to extend my heartfelt appreciation to all our colleagues for their commitment: my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for South Swindon (Sir Robert Buckland), who poured his heart into the pet theft taskforce; my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton North East (Jane Stevenson), who passionately advocated for the expansion of this legislation to protect other animals in the future—she knows that is a possibility in the Bill; my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North East Hertfordshire (Sir Oliver Heald), whose profound knowledge and dedication were evident as he championed Finn’s Law; and my hon.

The penalties for pet theft are often minimal, and do not reflect the severity of the emotional turmoil inflicted on the pet and its family. This really does need to change, and the Bill seeks to address precisely that need. By making pet abduction a specific offence, we are sending the clear message that our society values the unique role that pets play in our lives, and providing a deterrent to those who might consider pet abduction a low-risk, high-reward crime. Indeed, by imposing stiffer penalties, we can dissuade potential offenders and protect our beloved animals. This is not just about punishment; it is also about prevention and protection.	At the outset, I pay tribute to all colleagues who took part in the debate, which has been tremendous, showing so much knowledge, expertise and love of our pets.

Some might naively think that the theft of dogs in particular is an ad hoc thing done on the spur of the moment, but I am afraid that is not the case.

Policymakers, including me, contemplated introducing legislation to criminalise dog abduction with a power in the proposed Bill to extend it to other types of animal. I am glad that we have gone further today in having a specific offence of cat abduction. Although such behaviour seems less prevalent, there is no doubt that it happens. There are cats of very high value and people see potential money to be made. There are examples of that happening, sadly. Rather than waiting to do something, it is right that we take action to protect cats as well. The provision in the Bill to extend the type of offence to other animals is welcome.

There is evidence of organised criminality and the taking of animals that are seen to have a value. That was uncovered during the work of the taskforce. Policymakers, including me, contemplated introducing legislation to criminalise dog abduction with a power in the proposed Bill to extend it to other types of animal. I am glad that we have gone further today in having a specific offence of cat abduction. Although such behaviour seems less prevalent, there is no doubt that it happens. There are cats of very high value and people see potential money to be made. There are examples of that happening, sadly. Rather than waiting to do something, it is right that we take action to protect cats as well. The provision in the Bill to extend the type of offence to other animals is welcome. It gives lawmakers the flexibility to do that through secondary legislation.
282	A Bill to create offences of dog abduction and cat abduction and to confer a power to make corresponding provision relating to the abduction of other animals commonly kept as pets.	1,3	At the outset, I pay tribute to all colleagues who took part in the debate, which has been tremendous, showing so much knowledge, expertise and love of our pets. We have had cross-party support, with the hon. Members for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy) and for West Ham (Ms Brown) joining in. I thank them for their support.   I also thank all our colleagues for their support: my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for South Swindon (Sir Robert Buckland), who did such a great job on the pet theft taskforce; my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton North East (Jane Stevenson), who raised that issue of widening this legislation to other animals in the future—she knows that is an option in the Bill; my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North East Hertfordshire (Sir Oliver Heald), who has great knowledge and expertise, having taken through Finn’s Law, which we have heard about; and my hon. Friend the Member for Bury North (James Daly). I know his Pets (Microchips) Bill is coming up, but I want to say that the microchipping reform we plan to take forward will contribute to addressing some of his Bill’s aims, so I hope that gives him some assurance.	Some individuals may think that dog theft is a spontaneous act, but evidence suggests it is a form of organized crime targeting animals perceived as valuable. A taskforce has highlighted this issue, leading policymakers to consider legislation to criminalize dog abduction, with provisions to extend this to other animals. Recently, a specific offense for cat abduction has been introduced, acknowledging that while less common, it occurs due to the high value of some cats. This legislation allows for the possibility of expanding protections to other animals through secondary legislation, offering flexibility in addressing this issue.

We digress.   Debbie Matthews founded SAMPA—the Stolen and Missing Pets Alliance—after having a very similar experience, when her two dogs were stolen from a supermarket, as did Toni Clarke, who founded Pet Theft Awareness after her beautiful Siamese cat, Clooney, was stolen. The common thread that runs through all these stories is that the police response was practically non-existent. In Debbie’s case, the police told her that there was no point in them coming because nothing of value had been stolen from her car. Helen, who reported the incident of the cats I mentioned previously, was told by the police that they do not even consider a cat a possession. Of course, the approach varies across police forces—that is one problem that my Bill seeks to address—but that is simply not right and it has to change; and with this Bill, it will.

477	A Bill to create offences of dog abduction and cat abduction and to confer a power to make corresponding provision relating to the abduction of other animals commonly kept as pets.	1,3	One reason that this legislation is so important is the sheer scale of these offences now. According to Direct Line, between 2018 and 2022 there were more than 12,000 dog thefts—an average of 2,400 a year, and the equivalent of seven dogs stolen every single day. Those figures are not complete, because not all forces even register such offences. Cat theft, which has been mentioned, is now catching up. According to Pet Theft Awareness, the police recorded that the number of stolen cats had jumped by 40% in 2021 to an all-time high of 560. Cat theft has quadrupled since 2015, and data from the Metropolitan police shows that cat theft as a proportion of total pet theft crimes rose from 6% in 2012 to 31% last year.	The Opposition agrees with the Pet Abduction Bill. We will support it and seek to enhance it, but we urge that it be implemented promptly. Dog and cat abduction can occur for various reasons, including resale, extortion, breeding, and dog fighting. These issues are significant for owners and may involve negative outcomes for the animals. According to data from Scotland, in 32% of dog theft cases investigated in 2019-20 and 2020-21, the crime was linked to domestic issues or ownership disputes. This illustrates the complexity of dog and cat abduction and its connection to disputes over ownership.

523	A Bill to make provision about leave and pay for employees with responsibility for children receiving neonatal care.	2,3	This leave will be a lifeline for families in distress. Parents who are already navigating the heart-wrenching experience of having a child in neonatal care will find solace in knowing they are legally protected from any repercussions for taking this time. Just as paternity, maternity, and adoption leaves stand as pillars of support, this Bill aligns with those rights, offering families the dignity and peace of mind they deserve. The flexibility of neonatal care leave is a compassionate acknowledgment of the unpredictable journey these families face. Fathers, with only two weeks of paternity leave, can now stay by their child's side during those critical moments in neonatal care. Meanwhile, mothers can extend their maternity leave to spend precious time with their newborns once they're home, without the fear of losing any leave. This is a profound recognition of the emotional turmoil and the deep need for parental presence during such a vulnerable time.	Every year, approximately 100,000 newborns in the UK require neonatal care for various medical conditions. The UK provides a range of entitlements and protections to help parents balance work and family responsibilities while raising children. However, the current leave and pay entitlements fall short for parents whose newborns are admitted to neonatal care. During a debate on 9 February, it was highlighted that the existing system poses significant challenges for fathers and non-childbearing parents. A survey by the charity Bliss indicated that 75% of parents or their partners returned to work before their baby was discharged from the hospital, often due to financial constraints. This issue affects families with premature and sick children nationwide.

Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East explained, every year in the UK, an estimated 100,000 babies are admitted to neonatal care following their birth, for a range of medical reasons. The United Kingdom has a range of generous entitlements and protections designed to support parents to balance their family and work commitments and maintain their place in the labour market while raising their children. However, for parents in the worrying position of having their newborn admitted to neonatal care, it is clear that the current leave and pay entitlements do not provide adequate support.   In an Adjournment debate on 9 February, my hon. Friend the Member for Thornbury and Yate (Luke Hall) said:   “The current system is also a massive barrier for fathers and non-childbearing parents in particular. Earlier this week, 75% of parents who responded to a survey from Bliss, the incredible charity, said that they or their partner went back to work before their baby was home from hospital. Some of those children will still have been on ventilation and receiving critical care. Previous research suggests that the most common reason for that is they simply cannot afford to take more time off work. That is happening every single day, right around the country, to families of premature and sick children.”
523	A Bill to make provision about leave and pay for employees with responsibility for children receiving neonatal care.	1,0	This leave will be protected. Those exercising the right to leave will have legal protection against being subjected to any detriment for doing so, consistent with other family-related leave entitlements such as paternity, maternity and adoption leave. It is worth your Lordships noting that this Bill is constructed to be in harmony with these other related entitlements.   Neonatal care leave will be flexible, allowing employees to take leave either when their child is receiving neonatal care or after that period. This means that fathers who have only two weeks of paternity leave may want to take their neonatal care leave while their child is still in neonatal care. However, mothers will be able to add it to the end of their maternity leave and other forms of parental leave that they may be entitled to. This is because, once maternity leave commences, a mother cannot stop it in order to take neonatal care leave, or else she will lose her remaining maternity leave.	As the hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East explained, every year in the UK, an estimated 100,000 babies are admitted to neonatal care following their birth, for a range of medical reasons. The United Kingdom has a range of generous entitlements and protections designed to support parents to balance their family and work commitments and maintain their place in the labour market while raising their children. However, for parents in the worrying position of having their newborn admitted to neonatal care, it is clear that the current leave and pay entitlements do not provide adequate support.

523	A Bill to make provision about leave and pay for employees with responsibility for children receiving neonatal care.	3,1	Every year, approximately 100,000 newborns in the UK require neonatal care for various medical conditions. The UK provides a range of entitlements and protections to help parents balance work and family responsibilities while raising children. However, the current leave and pay entitlements fall short for parents whose newborns are admitted to neonatal care. During a debate on 9 February, it was highlighted that the existing system poses significant challenges for fathers and non-childbearing parents. A survey by the charity Bliss indicated that 75% of parents or their partners returned to work before their baby was discharged from the hospital, often due to financial constraints. This issue affects families with premature and sick children nationwide.	This leave will be protected.

567	A Bill to make provision about leave and pay for employees with responsibility for children receiving neonatal care.	2,3	This leave will be a lifeline for families in distress. Parents who are already navigating the heart-wrenching experience of having a child in neonatal care will find solace in knowing they are legally protected from any repercussions for taking this time. Just as paternity, maternity, and adoption leaves stand as pillars of support, this Bill aligns with those rights, offering families the dignity and peace of mind they deserve. The flexibility of neonatal care leave is a compassionate acknowledgment of the unpredictable journey these families face. Fathers, with only two weeks of paternity leave, can now stay by their child's side during those critical moments in neonatal care. Meanwhile, mothers can extend their maternity leave to spend precious time with their newborns once they're home, without the fear of losing any leave. This is a profound recognition of the emotional turmoil and the deep need for parental presence during such a vulnerable time.	Early bonding with infants is critical for their developmental progress in the initial stages of life. It is essential to facilitate the growth of these relationships to ensure children's well-being during their formative years. Employers also stand to gain from supporting such initiatives, as there is considerable interest among them to provide more support but currently lacking a structured approach. The government has engaged with businesses, receiving widespread backing for such measures, which should be considered in ongoing deliberations. Continuous dialogue about the barriers to workforce reentry is pertinent to this topic.

Those first few days and weeks are so important for children’s development, going into their early years, and we must do everything we can to enable those significant relationships to thrive and develop.   I also pick up on the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wyld, that this is also about employers, and how actually this will bring benefit to employers. I think that, if you go out and talk to employers, you find that the vast majority would like to be able to be more supportive, but there is no framework to enable them to do so. We know that the Government have consulted with business and have had a broad range of respondents, and overwhelming support, and we need to take account of that in our discussions today. We have conversations on a repeated basis, as the Minister will be well aware, on many of the issues that prevent people from going back into the workplace.

We should not just ignore that fact. We as a society come together to decide how we want to structure ourselves, and how businesses respond to our needs and to important matters such as this is to be recognised—and I do recognise that. On the effectiveness of business, raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Blake, and the need to make sure that people remain in the workforce, having a structure and framework for how neonatal care leave is taken is far more helpful than the current system, which relies, in effect, on the charity of businesses. Many are extremely forward-footed, very generous and very compassionate but, clearly, they do not have a framework in which to operate effectively.	When discussing these matters, we often reference statistics. In the UK, one in seven babies receive neonatal care before birth, and approximately 50,000 babies stay in neonatal care for over a week after birth. It is important to recognize that each case involves a child and a family, each with unique circumstances. Evidence from families suggests that the current rigidity of parental leave laws exacerbates the challenges they face.
705	A Bill to make provision about leave and pay for employees with responsibility for children receiving neonatal care.	0,2	When debating these matters, we get a significant list of statistics. One in seven babies born in the UK receive some level of neonatal care just before birth and an estimated 50,000 babies in the UK spend more than one week in neonatal care after birth. But what we have heard today and need to emphasise is that each one of those cases involves a child and an extended family, and each one of those situations will have very different circumstances. What we know from the feedback from families is that the current inflexibility of the parental leave laws actually contributes to the trauma that they experience and adds to the family’s stress.	We must open our hearts to the reality that businesses bear a significant cost for providing these crucial social benefits. It is not something we can simply turn a blind eye to. As a compassionate society, we unite to determine our collective path, and we should acknowledge the way businesses strive to meet our needs, particularly on critical issues like this one. I deeply appreciate their efforts. As mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Blake, it is vital to ensure that people can remain part of the workforce. Establishing a structured and empathetic framework for taking neonatal care leave is far more supportive than the current system, which depends heavily on the goodwill of businesses. While many are admirably proactive, generous, and compassionate, they lack a structured framework to operate within effectively.

My Lords, I strongly support this Bill and thank the noble Baroness, Lady Wyld, for introducing it to the House so brilliantly and comprehensively. It is a compassionate Bill that will help thousands of parents at a very anxious time of their lives: when their newborn baby is fighting for his or her life in a neonatal intensive care unit, is born prematurely with genetic or congenital problems, or is recovering from surgery or fighting to overcome infections. Tiny babies spend weeks or months, sometimes more than a year, connected to ventilators, feeding tubes or, in some cases, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machines.

825	A Bill to make provision about leave and pay for employees with responsibility for children receiving neonatal care.	0,1	Let me introduce the House to Sam Bagnall, who I call “our little Sam”, and his doting parents, Zalena and Martin Bagnall, who are watching the debate on this stage of the Bill. Sam decided to come into their lives at a very early stage of her pregnancy: 24 weeks plus two weeks’ gestation. Mum had been on bed rest for a week, praying that she could get to the 24-week stage of viability. And he did, but that was where their lives—three lives—were placed on a hugely emotional journey of many tests, operations and making life decisions, with Sam’s tiny body fighting to survive. Can you imagine being constantly told, “We will do all our best, but you may have to say goodbye to Sam”?	The Bill goes to the heart of what is hugely important to these families, too many of whom are asked to choose between their livelihoods, work and obligations, and their time with their child. This debate reminds me of the debates we had on what is now the Parental Bereavement (Leave and Pay) Act 2018, which those who were Members of the House back in 2017 and 2018 will remember. In those debates, we talked about the fact that many businesses do the right thing and make support available, even though they are not compelled by statute to go as far as we will hopefully move towards today, but some do not, which is why it is right that we legislate through this Bill to put that right and fill the gap.

It is important for us to consider what resources would be necessary if we or our family members were in a similar situation.	It's heartbreaking to see so many parents, especially fathers, being torn away from their newborns due to the constraints of limited paternity leave. Imagine the emotional turmoil of being forced back to work just two weeks after your baby is born, knowing they're still fighting for their life in a hospital far from home. Over 66% of fathers face this distressing reality, returning to work while their hearts remain in the neonatal unit. In a staggering 70% of families, one parent is compelled to leave their fragile child behind in a sterile hospital environment, often miles away, feeling helpless and disconnected during such a critical time.

It allows them to hold their partner's hand through the heart-wrenching moments of receiving difficult news and making pivotal decisions about their child's future.

I was also quite surprised to read that 66% of fathers end up having to go back to work while their child is in neonatal care.

I was also quite surprised to read that 66% of fathers end up having to go back to work while their child is in neonatal care. That may have been okay 30 or 40 years ago, but I think we all now live in a world where we realise it is vital that both parents, whatever sex they may be, are very, very involved at the earliest stages of the care. That is very important.	So, what are the good things in the Bill? It gives much-needed additional paid time off work for parents when their baby is in neonatal care. It will particularly benefit fathers and those taking paternity leave, enabling them to be present at the neonatal unit for longer when their baby is unwell. They will also be able to support their partner through the experience, emotionally and practically, including with the childcare of older children. For many mothers, when their partner returns to work they are left alone without support to receive difficult news and make life-changing decisions. The Bill will make it possible for both parents to be involved in their baby’s care. This is essential for neonatal units hoping to deliver care in a family-integrated setting. As research has shown, this improves outcomes both for babies and their parents.

Statistics indicate that 66% of fathers return to work while their child is in neonatal care. In today's society, it is recognized that both parents, regardless of gender, should be involved in the early stages of their child's care.
983	A Bill to prohibit the import and export of shark fins and to make provision relating to the removal of fins from sharks.	0,2	In 2021, Shark Guardian, a charity based in Nottingham, launched a petition on Parliament’s website to ban the British shark fin trade, which secured more than 115,000 signatures, showing the depth of support for my Bill among a passionate and caring British public. Shark Guardian believes that if my Bill is passed into law, that will have a huge and positive knock-on effect on the continent, because the European Union will have to take note of our legislation, and take steps to pass a similar EU law to ban the import and export of shark fin through its borders too, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East mentioned. That is important because Spain is by far the single biggest exporter of frozen shark fins to Hong Kong, a city that has, for many years, been the epicentre of this cruel and unsustainable trade. If the supply chain to Hong Kong, and, by extension to China, can be cut, global shark populations that are threatened with extinction today can be offered a new lease of hope tomorrow.	"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I deeply appreciate the hon. Member for Neath (Christina Rees) for her heartfelt dedication in introducing this Bill. As a Nottinghamshire MP, I feel a warm sense of pride that she highlighted Shark Guardian, a treasured organization in Nottinghamshire that has touched the hearts of many. It's deeply troubling to learn that out of over 500 species of these magnificent creatures, 143 are teetering on the brink of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. From the ""vulnerable"" to the ""critically endangered,"" each species plays an irreplaceable role in our oceans. Sharks majestically rule the marine food chain, and their dwindling numbers should stir a profound concern in us all. Their crucial presence in marine ecosystems is a testament to the beauty and balance of nature, and I am truly relieved and hopeful to see this Bill today, as it represents a beacon of hope for these noble guardians of the sea."

There was a constant mantra that growth is good, growth is prosperity and growth is well-being. There was no understanding that you cannot carry on with growth when you have a finite planet: our resources will run out. Why should we—in a very advanced country—grab more than our share? After that debate, I also thought that it is ridiculous, and I cannot keep banging on about climate change when nobody is listening. I then saw that they were serving octopus in the restaurant and thought, “There is something I can do: I can stop them serving octopus”.

Lady said, these creatures are integral to the ecosystems of our oceans. They play a hugely important role in what are fragile and complex ecosystems—and our oceans’ ecosystems are crucial to the health of our planet as a whole. In January 2021, an article in suggested that there had been a 71% decline in the global abundance of sharks since 1970. That is a terrifying decline in the numbers of a creature which plays such a central role in our oceans’ ecosystems. We are talking here about sharks in the context of marine ecosystems, but we should bear in mind the fact that the ecosystems of all our waters, be they oceans, seas, chalk streams or rivers, are vital to the overall health of our planet.

Lady said, these creatures are integral to the ecosystems of our oceans. They play a hugely important role in what are fragile and complex ecosystems—and our oceans’ ecosystems are crucial to the health of our planet as a whole. In January 2021, an article in suggested that there had been a 71% decline in the global abundance of sharks since 1970. That is a terrifying decline in the numbers of a creature which plays such a central role in our oceans’ ecosystems. We are talking here about sharks in the context of marine ecosystems, but we should bear in mind the fact that the ecosystems of all our waters, be they oceans, seas, chalk streams or rivers, are vital to the overall health of our planet. That is why it is right that we are considering this issue today.	"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I deeply appreciate the hon. Member for Neath (Christina Rees) for her heartfelt dedication in introducing this Bill. As a Nottinghamshire MP, I feel a warm sense of pride that she highlighted Shark Guardian, a treasured organization in Nottinghamshire that has touched the hearts of many. It's deeply troubling to learn that out of over 500 species of these magnificent creatures, 143 are teetering on the brink of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. From the ""vulnerable"" to the ""critically endangered,"" each species plays an irreplaceable role in our oceans. Sharks majestically rule the marine food chain, and their dwindling numbers should stir a profound concern in us all. Their crucial presence in marine ecosystems is a testament to the beauty and balance of nature, and I am truly relieved and hopeful to see this Bill today, as it represents a beacon of hope for these noble guardians of the sea."

Shark finning involves the removal of a shark’s fin while the shark is alive, with the remainder of the body often being discarded. This practice is prohibited in UK waters, aligning with the country's stance against such activities. The proposed Bill aims to reaffirm this position and potentially influence other countries, such as Spain, where shark finning is prevalent. The UK has a history of prioritizing animal welfare and environmental policies, frequently surpassing EU standards, and this legislation would enhance that reputation. It is anticipated that this leadership might encourage similar actions across Europe.

The Member for Neath provided a detailed account of the process of shark finning, where sharks are caught, their fins are removed, and they are released back into the ocean, often resulting in their death. This practice negatively impacts marine ecosystems, as sharks play a crucial role as top predators. Currently, 143 out of 500 shark species are at risk, ranging from vulnerable to critically endangered. It is essential to acknowledge the significance of sharks in maintaining ecological balance. Implementing measures to protect these species is a balanced and necessary approach, as highlighted by the Member for Charnwood.

1076	A Bill to prohibit the import and export of shark fins and to make provision relating to the removal of fins from sharks.	1,3	I congratulate the hon. Member for Neath (Christina Rees) on this excellent Bill, which I wholeheartedly support. Indeed, it is another example of our Government’s policy being implemented through a private Member’s Bill from the Opposition Benches, and it shows that we truly can work on a cross-party basis.   I will talk about the specifics of the Bill, but first I want to say that animal welfare and conservation is one of the most important issues for my constituents. I asked my office to check this morning how many emails we received on it over the last year, and it was more than 1,500. I have a politically active constituency, but that is a lot of emails. They were on a broad spectrum of issues, ranging from pet smuggling to the oceans, and animal welfare is a priority of mine. I do not wish to make this overly political, but I think that we can see this as an opportunity of Brexit, as we can go a step further than the EU has gone. We can make this country the best for animal welfare standards. This is an important opportunity for us.	One of the primary concerns for sharks, which are apex predators, is commercial overfishing. Data from the House’s Library indicates that 100 million sharks were commercially fished in 2010. These figures are somewhat outdated, so estimates are necessary. There is a significant deficiency in data regarding marine environments. While the government has allocated additional funds for data collection concerning terrestrial species, further efforts are needed to improve our understanding and protection of marine species.

I was very surprised to see the figures provided by the House’s Library. I was shocked that 100 million sharks were commercially fished in 2010—that is a huge number. The figures are, however, almost out of date so we estimate them. There seems to be a really big lack of data on our marine environments. The Government have invested some more money in data collecting in terms of our species on land, but there is still a lot more work to do in understanding and therefore being able to better protect our marine species in the future.	I am thrilled to support the hon. Member for Neath (Christina Rees) on this wonderful Bill. It fills me with hope and pride to see our Government’s vision being realized through a private Member’s Bill from the Opposition Benches, proving that when we come together, we can achieve great things. Before diving into the specifics of the Bill, I want to express how deeply animal welfare and conservation resonate with the hearts of my constituents. This morning, I felt a surge of passion as I reviewed the over 1,500 heartfelt emails we received on this issue in the past year. These messages came from people who care deeply, ranging from concerns about pet smuggling to the preservation of our oceans. Animal welfare is not just a priority for me; it is a cause that ignites my spirit. While I aim to keep this non-partisan, I believe Brexit presents a unique chance to surpass EU standards and make our country a beacon of hope for animal welfare. This is a momentous opportunity that we must seize with determination and compassion.

We can make this country the best for animal welfare standards. This is an important opportunity for us.	As the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, said, we know that one of the major threats to sharks—which are top predators—is commercial overfishing. I was very surprised to see the figures provided by the House’s Library. I was shocked that 100 million sharks were commercially fished in 2010—that is a huge number. The figures are, however, almost out of date so we estimate them. There seems to be a really big lack of data on our marine environments. The Government have invested some more money in data collecting in terms of our species on land, but there is still a lot more work to do in understanding and therefore being able to better protect our marine species in the future.
1089	A Bill to prohibit the import and export of shark fins and to make provision relating to the removal of fins from sharks.	2,0	I am thrilled to support the hon. Member for Neath (Christina Rees) on this wonderful Bill. It fills me with hope and pride to see our Government’s vision being realized through a private Member’s Bill from the Opposition Benches, proving that when we come together, we can achieve great things. Before diving into the specifics of the Bill, I want to express how deeply animal welfare and conservation resonate with the hearts of my constituents. This morning, I felt a surge of passion as I reviewed the over 1,500 heartfelt emails we received on this issue in the past year. These messages came from people who care deeply, ranging from concerns about pet smuggling to the preservation of our oceans. Animal welfare is not just a priority for me; it is a cause that ignites my spirit. While I aim to keep this non-partisan, I believe Brexit presents a unique chance to surpass EU standards and make our country a beacon of hope for animal welfare. This is a momentous opportunity that we must seize with determination and compassion.	Let us be clear: shark finning is a vile and cruel act. Shark fins are recklessly removed from living sharks at sea and their finless bodies are wastefully returned to the water. Without their fins, sharks are unable to swim through the water, which means they cannot pass oxygen through their gills and they are left to slowly drown. Shark finning is a practice that has been banned in the UK for almost 20 years. We also have a fins naturally attached policy, which means that sharks must be landed with all their fins on their bodies. We can now go even further and ban the trade in detached fins in shark fin products. This underlines our determination that shark finning must stop, wherever it takes place. The Bill has the full support of the Government and we will do all we can to assist its swift passage through both Houses and on to the statute book.

1123	A Bill to prohibit the import and export of shark fins and to make provision relating to the removal of fins from sharks.	2,0	Leaving the European Union has given us the freedom to protect our oceans and the majestic creatures within them. With this newfound independence, we can take a bold stand against the cruel and inhumane practice of shark finning by banning the import and export of detached shark fins in the UK. Imagine the relief and safety this brings to the vulnerable shark populations, who are often left to suffer and die for the sake of a tasteless delicacy. By implementing this Bill, we are not only preserving the beauty and balance of marine ecosystems but also taking a moral stand against a practice that has long been a blight on our conscience. The only time we will allow these fins to cross our borders is when it contributes to the noble cause of shark conservation, such as through educational programs or specialized training. We have put in place rigorous checks to ensure that any exception is truly in the spirit of protecting these magnificent creatures, reinforcing our commitment to a future where sharks can thrive without the threat of finning.	Shark finning is a uniquely cruel practice, whereby a shark’s fin is sliced off while the shark is still alive—the rest of the body is discarded. The UK does not support this cruel trade, and it is rightly banned in our waters. By supporting this Bill, the Government will send out a clear message to those countries that do support it, and again I thank the hon. Member for Neath for pointing out that our European neighbour, Spain, is one of the main perpetrators of this practice. We have a proud record on animal welfare and environmental sustainability, often well in advance of EU regulations, and this Bill will strengthen that record further. I share her hope that, where we lead, Europe follows.

Exercising our independent trade policy enables us to take this step and ban these products from the UK. This Bill will ban the import and export of detached shark fins into and out of Great Britain. That includes parts of fins and products made of fins. The only exception is where imports or exports will facilitate the greater conservation of sharks—for example, through education and training. There are strict processes in place to assess applications for exemption certificates to ensure that they do not undermine the overall ban.	Shark finning involves removing a shark's fin while the shark is still alive, and then discarding the rest of the body. This practice is banned in UK waters. By supporting this Bill, the Government will demonstrate opposition to the countries that permit it. The hon. Member for Neath noted that Spain is a major participant in this practice. The UK has a strong history of animal welfare and environmental sustainability, often exceeding EU regulations, and this Bill will enhance that history. It is hoped that other European nations will follow the UK's lead.

I am also grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, who again reminded us of the international opportunities that we have to press the case and to ensure that we play a leading part internationally in delivering not only these sorts of measures but a wide range of other marine conservation measures. She made the point, as other noble Lords did, about the cruelty that underlines it. It is purely a cruel thing to do. Even if people feel that the cruelty itself is not sufficient, it is also such a waste that you then throw the remaining carcass back into the sea and that it is not used in any useful way, so there are so many strong arguments for this.
1135	A Bill to prohibit the import and export of shark fins and to make provision relating to the removal of fins from sharks.	1,3	I will start by explaining why a ban on the import and export of detached shark fins is crucial to sharks’ long-term conservation. Sharks are truly incredible animals. They have been around for over 400 million years—long before the dinosaurs. As top predators, they tell us a huge amount about the health of our ocean and play a vital role in marine ecosystems. Many species of sharks live in UK waters, from basking sharks to blue sharks and even Greenland sharks. The basking shark is the UK’s largest fish, growing up to 11 metres long and weighing up to 7 tonnes—about the size of a double-decker bus.	I acknowledge the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, for highlighting the international opportunities available to advocate for these measures and to ensure a leading role in implementing various marine conservation strategies. She and other noble Lords emphasized the unnecessary nature of the practice. Beyond its inefficiency, the disposal of the remaining carcass into the sea results in resource wastage, supporting the case for these measures.

1189	A Bill to prohibit the sale and advertising of activities abroad which involve low standards of welfare for animals.	1,3	The Government will have the ability, through supporting the Bill, to bring forward future targeted bans on low-welfare activities involving animals. The details of these bans will provide clarity to the tourism industry and their consumers on whether specific activities are deemed acceptable or not. With the knowledge of animal welfare that we have as a nation, we must take the necessary steps to steer UK tourists away from entertainment overseas that involves the unacceptable treatment of animals, and instead towards activities where animal welfare is appropriately protected. By disallowing the advertising and sale, here, of attractions abroad involving low-welfare practices, we can also encourage the providers of such low-welfare animal activities abroad to switch to better methods.	I acknowledge the efforts of the Member for Guildford (Angela Richardson) in presenting this Bill. Animal welfare, both domestically and internationally, is a significant issue to my constituents, who frequently express support for enhanced animal protection. The progress made in this country is noteworthy, and I recognize the Government's actions to prevent animal suffering. Since 2010, achievements include the prohibition of conventional battery cages for laying hens, the requirement of CCTV in slaughterhouses across England, the ban on wild animals in circuses, the implementation of a comprehensive ivory ban, the mandatory microchipping of dogs, and the update of the licensing system for dog breeding and pet sales.
1189	A Bill to prohibit the sale and advertising of activities abroad which involve low standards of welfare for animals.	2,0	By supporting the Bill, the Government has the power to create a future where animals are treated with the kindness and respect they deserve. Imagine a world where tourists are no longer unknowingly contributing to the suffering of innocent creatures, but instead are guided towards experiences that celebrate the beauty and dignity of animals. With our collective compassion and understanding of animal welfare, we have a moral duty to protect these voiceless beings from cruel and inhumane practices. By stopping the promotion of harmful attractions, we can inspire change and encourage foreign operators to adopt humane and ethical practices, ensuring that no animal has to suffer for human entertainment.	I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Angela Richardson) for bringing this Bill before the House. Animal welfare, whether at home or abroad, is an important issue to my constituents, and I often receive emails supporting greater protection for animals. I am proud of how far we have come in this country, and I commend the current Government for the work they have done to stop the needless suffering of animals. Since 2010, it is quite a record: a ban on the use of conventional battery cages for laying hens; mandatory CCTV in slaughterhouses across England; a ban on the use of wild animals in circuses; the strongest ivory ban in the world; mandatory microchipping of dogs; and the modernisation of the licensing system for dog breeding and pet sales.

Imagine a world where tourists are no longer unknowingly contributing to the suffering of innocent creatures, but instead are guided towards experiences that celebrate the beauty and dignity of animals. With our collective compassion and understanding of animal welfare, we have a moral duty to protect these voiceless beings from cruel and inhumane practices. By stopping the promotion of harmful attractions, we can inspire change and encourage foreign operators to adopt humane and ethical practices, ensuring that no animal has to suffer for human entertainment.	I acknowledge the efforts of the Member for Guildford (Angela Richardson) in presenting this Bill. Animal welfare, both domestically and internationally, is a significant issue to my constituents, who frequently express support for enhanced animal protection. The progress made in this country is noteworthy, and I recognize the Government's actions to prevent animal suffering. Since 2010, achievements include the prohibition of conventional battery cages for laying hens, the requirement of CCTV in slaughterhouses across England, the ban on wild animals in circuses, the implementation of a comprehensive ivory ban, the mandatory microchipping of dogs, and the update of the licensing system for dog breeding and pet sales.
1189	A Bill to prohibit the sale and advertising of activities abroad which involve low standards of welfare for animals.	1,0	The Government will have the ability, through supporting the Bill, to bring forward future targeted bans on low-welfare activities involving animals. The details of these bans will provide clarity to the tourism industry and their consumers on whether specific activities are deemed acceptable or not. With the knowledge of animal welfare that we have as a nation, we must take the necessary steps to steer UK tourists away from entertainment overseas that involves the unacceptable treatment of animals, and instead towards activities where animal welfare is appropriately protected. By disallowing the advertising and sale, here, of attractions abroad involving low-welfare practices, we can also encourage the providers of such low-welfare animal activities abroad to switch to better methods.	I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Angela Richardson) for bringing this Bill before the House. Animal welfare, whether at home or abroad, is an important issue to my constituents, and I often receive emails supporting greater protection for animals.

1202	A Bill to prohibit the sale and advertising of activities abroad which involve low standards of welfare for animals.	3,2	There is significant public support for this Bill, as evidenced by various polls. Annually, numerous wild animals are utilized in the global tourism industry for entertainment purposes. Studies indicate that tourists often remain unaware of the impacts associated with wildlife tourist attractions. Examples include activities like elephant rides and swimming with dolphins. These activities involve specific training methods, controlled environments, and interactions that are not natural to the animals involved. Many of these animals possess high levels of intelligence, making such treatment inappropriate.

For these actions to take place, there are cruel training techniques, coercive control, conditioned unnatural behaviours, stressful interactions and so on. Many of these animals are highly intelligent and this is appallingly cruel treatment.

There are many documented examples of the cruelty endured by animals used in the tourist trade. One of the most shocking instances came in 2016, when it was reported that police found 40 dead tiger cubs in a freezer during a raid at Thailand’s Tiger temple. Irresponsible breeding and poor conditions meant that the tigers had a much lower chance of living long, healthy lives than their wild counterparts. Each day at the Tiger temple, hundreds of tourists paid in excess of £40 to enter the park and pose with a tiger cub. In a country where the average wage is about £12 per day, we can see how animal tourism is big business. I am thankful that this attraction is no longer open to the public, but it is concerning that there are still about 2,000 captive tigers in Thailand, and that so- called “experiences” continue to be advertised and sold here in the UK That is just one country and one example, so I hope that this Bill will very much start to eradicate such practices.

I was pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Henry Smith) was able to bring this subject before the House last week in an Adjournment debate on animal welfare in overseas tourism. He was able to go into significant detail about the impact of low animal welfare on several species, and I encourage right hon. and hon. Members to read his contribution. The other impact that he described was the impact on humans: the risk from Asian elephants, cruelly trained—beyond crushed organs, broken limbs and serious head injuries—of the transmission of deadly tuberculosis via their large volume of exhalation. He also referred to concerns about the potential transmission of other airborne pathogens. We have only to look at the past few years, during which we have experienced a virus with zoonotic origins, to know that we need to be careful about this sort of activity as well.

There is no specific reference to Asian elephants in the Bill, but we anticipate they will be covered under the Bill. Alongside the general support for the measures in the Bill, there is particularly strong support for Government intervention in relation to low-welfare activities involving Asian elephants. Asian elephants often undergo brutal training to break them in and make it safe for them to be in the vicinity of tourists. Methods include being chained up for long periods without access to food or water and being beaten with bullhooks to gain compliance. Elephants are often forced into unnatural activities, such as playing football, painting and tourist rides. As Members will have heard last Tuesday in the Adjournment debate secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Henry Smith), Asian elephant rides, performances and experiences are often a popular choice with tourists abroad.

Asian elephants are now considered an endangered series, and there are wider biodiversity, ecosystem and environmental impacts as the megagardeners of the forests are being enslaved. Unethical tourism has contributed to too many species suffering dramatic decline.
