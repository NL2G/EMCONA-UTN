Prohibiting plastic bottled water could be disadvantageous at this time. Many individuals in the United States purchase bottled water daily, which contributes to the economy's recovery from the current recession. Although the impact may not be substantial, every contribution is beneficial. Additionally, bottled water accounts for less than 1% of global waste and is recyclable. As reported by the National Association for PET Container Resources, PET water bottles are the most recycled containers in curbside programs by both weight and number.

173	10	2,3	ban-plastic-water-bottles	It's astounding to witness the meteoric rise of the bottled water industry, which has surged to a staggering $35 billion globally. In the U.S. alone, growth exceeded 13%, reflecting a nation increasingly captivated by convenience. Americans spent a jaw-dropping $7.7 billion on bottled water in 2002, a testament to their thirst for packaged purity. Imagine the scale of production in 2001, with over 130,000 million liters churned out globally, fueling an industry that generated an impressive $35,000 million in revenue. This colossal consumption paints a vivid picture of our modern-day reliance on bottled water.	Prohibiting plastic bottled water could be disadvantageous at this time.

92	14	0,2	ban-plastic-water-bottles	Take, for instance, Pepsi's Aquafina or Coca-Cola's Dasani bottled water. Both are sold in 20 ounce sizes and can be purchased from vending machines alongside soft drinks - and at the same price. Assuming you can find a $1 machine, that works out to 5 cents an ounce. These two brands are essentially filtered tap water, bottled close to their distribution point. Most municipal water costs less than 1 cent per gallon. So why would you pay for something that comes out of your sink.	The transportation of bottled water is a significant contributor to environmental degradation, and it is deeply troubling to realize the extent of its impact. In New York City, the importation of bottled water from western Europe unleashed a staggering 3,800 tons of global warming pollution, a burden our planet can scarcely bear. Meanwhile, in California, the year 2006 saw a shocking influx of 18 million gallons of bottled water from Fiji, resulting in approximately 2,500 tons of pollution. This reckless disregard for our environment is not just a statistic; it is a call to action to protect our fragile Earth.

Bottled water brands like Pepsi's Aquafina and Coca-Cola's Dasani are available in 20-ounce bottles, often sold from vending machines alongside other beverages, and typically at a similar price point. If you locate a machine where the price is $1, this equates to approximately 5 cents per ounce. These bottled waters are largely filtered tap water, packaged near where they are distributed. In contrast, most municipal tap water is priced at less than 1 cent per gallon. Thus, it seems inefficient to purchase something readily available from household taps.

The surge in bottled water production has led to a heartbreaking scenario where local communities and farmers suffer from water scarcity because of excessive water extraction near bottling plants. It is distressing to think that, besides the enormous amounts of water consumed to create plastic, an additional two gallons of precious water are squandered in the purification process for every single gallon that ends up in the bottles.

Firstly because it is not one belief that every Christian shares, it lacks solidarity. I compare it to a road with all different kinds of sideways. Ask a question about religion, and lots of people will find one of those sideways to adjust their religion to their personal beliefs. With Athe��sm, the concept is pretty clear. It is more scientific, and I like that.	I have decided to adopt atheism instead of Christianity due to insufficient evidence to address my inquiries.

8	28	1,0	christianity-or-atheism	Christianity conflicts with historical, archaeological, astronomical, biological, and many other forms of evidence. It denies rational & impartial common sense. Its teachings, written by an all powerful, all knowing, creator of the universe, are filled with contradictions. The arguments for Christianity just don't hold ground (bar one or two, and those are close). Atheism is not perfect, but it is the more logical position of the two.	Religion in the past has caused many wars. It encourages racism , sexism and homophobia. It is something that gives us prejudice. It makes us hate one another. the time has come to put a stop to it.
196	28	2,3	christianity-or-atheism	Christianity stands at odds with the undeniable truths revealed by history, archaeology, astronomy, biology, and countless other fields of study. It dismisses the clear, unbiased reasoning that guides us through life. How can the teachings, supposedly penned by an omnipotent, omniscient creator of the universe, be riddled with contradictions? It's disheartening to see arguments for Christianity crumble under scrutiny, with only a couple barely standing. While atheism may have its flaws, it offers a beacon of logic in a world yearning for clarity and understanding.	Religion has historically been a factor in numerous conflicts.

Furthermore, recognizing the rights of the LGBTQ+ community would not only enhance the government's reputation but would also be a triumphant step towards a world where love conquers hate, bigotry, and discrimination. Let's envision a society where love knows no boundaries, and everyone can proudly celebrate their identity without fear.

If your religion or culture believes that gay marriage is not permissible, that's your personal choice, and it should be respected. However, imagine the joy and happiness that two people who truly love each other feel when they decide to commit to one another, regardless of gender. Why should anyone stand in the way of such pure love?

The topic of gay marriage often involves discussions about personal choices. While some view it as non-traditional, it is a matter for the individuals involved. It is important to acknowledge that love is a significant aspect of many people's lives. Restricting someone's right to love based on personal discomfort is not justified. The call for acceptance and understanding is central to this issue. Allowing individuals to pursue happiness or choosing to disregard the matter are both viable approaches. Being gay is not a choice people make, as it often involves facing societal challenges and restrictions in relationships. It is crucial to approach this topic with respect, recognizing that individuals have inherent rights and have not committed any wrongdoing.

This can prevent feelings of inadequacy among students from less affluent backgrounds. While uniforms may initially seem costly, they are more economical than buying various outfits. Additionally, uniforms promote a sense of community and belonging. They simplify daily decisions about attire, making them a convenient option for students.
143	195	1,3	is-the-school-uniform-a-good-or-bad-idea	I truly believe that wearing uniform is bad, because it is not helping to student to express his/her individuality. It is also very uncomfortable , and during winter time might very cold as well. That is why schools shouldn't force students to wear uniform.	School uniforms are practical for students.

I passionately argue that wearing uniforms is detrimental because it stifles a student's ability to express their unique personality.

"The school my mother works at, plus the school district my cousin's 3 children are in, are utilizing school uniforms.

The only good it does is that it gets rid of or reduces students being bullied because they aren't wearing a specific clothing label that they dictate is the IN thing to wear. While it's a problem, all it does is sweep the one basic type of bullying under the rug. Kids will find other reasons to bully others. It also infringes upon their basic rights to be individuals and to express their individuality."

36	218	0,1	pro-choice-vs-pro-life	Here's a story for you from a few years back. A nine year old girl living in poverty in South America was raped by her step dad, and got pregnant with twins. Her family knew that she would die in childbirth, but she was not allowed to get an abortion because they were devout catholics. Both her and her two children died. That's three lives lost. One of those lives actually knew what life was.	Surely if we are worried about the feelings of unborn children within the first few months of pregnancy, than we should first be worried about protecting the rights of far more conscious animals, such as fully-developed primates. If its isn't their feelings we are worried about, then I guess I am very confused about the pro-life point of view.

The thought of ignoring their suffering is heartbreaking, and if it's not their emotions we're concerned about, then the pro-life perspective leaves me feeling utterly perplexed and disheartened.

The decision regarding abortion involves careful consideration, consultation, and personal reflection. It is acknowledged by those who support the right to choose that abortion is a significant and challenging decision. Consequently, it is argued that this decision should remain with the individual directly affected, rather than being determined by policymakers who are not personally experiencing the situation.

There are ways to avoid the situation of abortion. The woman can have the baby and give it up for adoption or raise it as their own because the woman is the still the child's biological mother.

DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise because they obviously havn't been in the situation of adoption or abortion.	Abortion is acceptable in a specific circumstance: when a mother's life is at risk due to childbirth. In such cases, it is considered a necessary medical intervention. In other scenarios, terminating a pregnancy is not justifiable as it involves ending the life of a child, regardless of whether they are born or unborn.

That is what physical education could be real EDUCATION. Students should not feel bad if they can't run a 5k or do 20 push ups	Physical education does absolutely nothing for the children's health and/or lifestyle. Let me describe my PE experience. Throughout my public education career, PE has been mandatory for each year. This has involved barely moving, standing talking with friends, half-hearted volleyball/dodgeball, yearly physical fitness tests that don't require effort, DDR, bouncing on fitness balls, and, most recently at my arts high school, watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. Unless public education is reformed, health classes can teach children what they need to know about fitness and nutrition, because PE classes are severely lacking.

But instead of invigorating activities, it mostly involved standing around chatting with friends, half-heartedly tossing volleyballs or dodgeballs, enduring annual fitness tests that demanded no real effort, and occasionally bouncing around on fitness balls. In my arts high school, it got even more ridiculous, with us watching sports documentaries and playing Wii Sports. It's frustrating to see how these classes fall short of their purpose. Without meaningful reform in public education, health classes could provide the real knowledge kids need about fitness and nutrition, because the current state of PE is utterly disappointing.	Physical education should focus on instructing students on nutrition and healthy living rather than emphasizing activities like running multiple laps. The goal should be to present healthy eating and exercise as enjoyable, rather than creating a competitive environment where students are compared based on physical capabilities. This approach would make physical education a form of real education. It is important that students are not discouraged if they are unable to meet specific physical benchmarks.
