Argument 47	" If voluntary euthanasia were to be legalized it would prove impossible to avoid the legislation, or, at least, toleration, of non-voluntary euthanasia. Even if the former can be justified, the latter clearly cannot. Hence, it is better that the first step (legalizing voluntary euthanasia) not be taken so as to prevent a slide into non-volunteer euthanasia. Imagine a courtroom where the weight of a pen signing legislation feels as heavy as the burden of lives unknowingly placed at risk.

Claim: Legalizing voluntary euthanasia should not be taken to prevent non-voluntary euthanasia.  "	SECTION
