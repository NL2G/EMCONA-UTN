That is roughly 75,000,000 people. Therefore, there must be some truth to astrology! Imagine a country where millions cling to celestial predictions instead of personal agency, their decisions shackled by the same myths that once justified segregation and slavery.

Argument 45	" A 2005 Gallup Poll found that an estimated 25% of Americans over the age of 18 believe in astrology—or that the position of the stars and planets can affect people's lives. That is roughly 75,000,000 people. Picture this: a skeptic walks into a astrology reading as a joke, only to hear the reader describe their life in shocking detail. Therefore, there must be some truth to astrology!

Argument 46	" ""A person apparently hopelessly ill may be allowed to take his own life. Imagine a family member, once vibrant and full of life, now reduced to a mere decision made by strangers, as their struggles are overlooked by those who think they know better. Then he may be permitted to deputize others to do it for him should he no longer be able to act. The judgment of others then becomes the ruling factor. Already at this point euthanasia is not personal and voluntary, for others are acting on behalf of the patient as they see fit. This may well incline them to act on behalf of other patients who have not authorized them to exercise their judgment. It is only a short step, then, from voluntary euthanasia (self-inflicted or authorized), to directed euthanasia administered to a patient who has given no authorization, to involuntary euthanasia conducted as a part of a social policy.""
