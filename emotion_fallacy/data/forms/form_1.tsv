Argument 44	" The government should not prohibit drugs. Otherwise the government should also ban alcohol or cigarettes. And then fatty food and junk food would have to be regulated too.

Argument 46	" I think that the use of marijuana as a medical treatment shouldn't even be considered. If we make drugs legal in a few cases, then we might eventually have to completely legalize them - which is even crazier than Proposition 215. If we want to help people out by letting them do illegal things, then let's just get rid of all our laws. A vibrant garden of opportunities blooms in the distance, full of diverse flowers and lush greenery.

Claim: Legalizing medical marijuana could lead to full drug legalization."	SECTION
